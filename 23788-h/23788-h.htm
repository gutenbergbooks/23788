<h2>GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>These articles recovered from the MSS. of De Quincey
will, the Editor believes, be found of substantive value.
In some cases they throw fresh light on his opinions and
ways of thinking; in other cases they deal with topics
which are not touched at all in his collected works: and
certainly, when read alongside the writings with which
the public is already familiar, will give altogether a new
idea of his range both of interests and activities. The
'Brevia,' especially, will probably be regarded as throwing
more light on his character and individuality&mdash;exhibiting
more of the inner life, in fact&mdash;than any number of
letters or reminiscences from the pens of others would be
found to do. It is as though the ordinary reader were
asked to sit down at ease with the author, when he is in
his most social and communicative mood, when he has
donned his dressing-gown and slippers, and is inclined to
unbosom himself, and that freely, on matters which
usually, and in general society, he would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
inclined to shun, or at all events to pass over lightly.
Here we have him at one moment presenting the results
of speculations the loftiest that can engage the mind of
man; at another making note of whimsical or surprising
points in the man or woman he has met with, or in the
books he has read; at another, amusing himself with the
most recent anecdote, or <i>bon-mot</i>, or reflecting on the
latest accident or murder, or good-naturedly noting odd
lapses in style in magazine or newspaper.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the author himself was
inclined to lay such weight on these stray notes, as might
be presumed from the form in which they are here presented.
That might give the impression of a most
methodic worker and thinker, who had before him a
carefully-indexed commonplace book, into which he
posted at the proper place his rough notes and suggestions.
That was not De Quincey's way. If he was not
one of the wealthy men who care not how they give, he
was one who made the most careless record even of what
was likely to be valuable&mdash;at all events to himself. His
habit was to make notes just as they occurred to him,
and on the sheet that he chanced to have at the moment
before him. It might be the 'copy' for an article indeed,
and in a little square patch at the corner&mdash;separated from
the main text by an insulating line of ink drawn round
the foreign matter&mdash;through this, not seldom, when
finished he would lightly draw his pen; meaning probably
to return to it when his MS. came back to him from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
printer, which accounts, it may be, in some measure for
his reluctance to get rid of, or to destroy, 'copy' already
printed from. Sometimes we have found on a sheet a
dozen or so of lines of a well-known article; and the rest
filled up with notes, some written one way of the paper,
some another, and now and then entangled in the most
surprising fashion. In these cases, where the notes, of
course, were meant for his own eye, he wrote in a small
spidery handwriting with many contractions&mdash;a kind of
shorthand of his own, and very different indeed from his
ordinary clean, clear, neat penmanship. In many cases
these notes demanded no little care and closeness in
deciphering&mdash;the more that the MSS. had been tumbled
about, and were often deeply stained by glasses other
than inkstands having been placed upon them. 'Within
that circle none dared walk but he,' said Tom Hood in his
genially humorous way; and many of these thoughts
were thus partially or wholly encircled. Pages of articles
that had already been printed were intermixed with others
that had not; and the first piece of work that I entered
on was roughly to separate the printed from the unprinted&mdash;first
having carefully copied out from the former any of
the spidery-looking notes interjected there, to which I
have already referred. The next process was to arrange
the many separate pages and seeming fragments into
heaps, by subjects; and finally to examine these carefully
and, with a view to 'connections,' to place them together.
In not a few cases where the theme was attractive and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
the prospect promising, utter failure to complete the
article or sketch was the result, the opening or ending
passages, or a page in the middle, having been unfortunately
destroyed or lost.</p>

<p>So numerous were these notes, so varied their subjects,
that one got quite a new idea of the extreme electrical
quality of his mind, as he himself called it; and I shall
have greatly failed in my endeavour in the case of these
volumes, if I have not succeeded in imparting something
of the same impression to the reader. Here we have
proof that vast schemes, such as the great history of
England, of which Mr. James Hogg, senr., humorously
told us in his 'Recollections' ('Memoir,' ch. ed., pp. 330,
331), were not merely subjects of conversation and jest,
but that he had actually proceeded to build up masses of
notes and figures with a view to these; and various slips
and pages remain to show that he had actually commenced
to write the history of England. The short
article, included in the present volume, on the 'Power of
the House of Commons as Custodian of the Purse,' is
marked for 'My History of England.' Other portions
are marked as intended for 'My book on the Infinite,'
and others still 'For my book on the Relations of Christianity
to Man.' One can infer, indeed, that several of
the articles well-known to us, notably 'Christianity as an
Organ of Political Movement,' for one, were originally
conceived as portions of a great work on 'Christianity in
Relation to Human Development.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span></p>

<p>It is thus necessary to be very explicit in stating
that, though these notes are as faithfully reproduced as
has been possible to me, the classification and arrangement
of them, under which they assume the aspect of
something of one connected essay on the main subject, I
alone am responsible for; though I do not believe, so
definite and clear were his ideas on certain subjects and
in certain relations, that he himself would have regarded
them as losing anything by such arrangement, but rather
gaining very much, if they were to be given at all to the
public.</p>

<p>Several of the articles in this volume suggest that he
also contemplated a great work on 'Paganism and Christianity,'
in which he would have demonstrated that
Paganism had exhausted all the germs of progress that
lay within it; and that all beyond the points reached by
Paganism is due to Christianity, and alone to Christianity,
which, in opening up a clear view of the infinite
through purely experimental mediums in man's heart,
touched to new life, science, philosophy, art, invention
and every kind of culture.</p>

<p>Respecting the recovered 'Suspiria,' all that it is needful
to say will be found in an introduction special to that
head, and it does not seem to me that I need to add here
anything more. In every other respect the articles must
speak for themselves.</p>

<h2><i>I. SUSPIRIA DE PROFUNDIS.</i></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Introduction, with Complete List of the 'Suspiria.'</span></h3>


<p>The finale to the first part of the 'Suspiria,' as we find
from a note of the author's own, was to include 'The
Dark Interpreter,' 'The Spectre of the Brocken,' and
'Savannah-la-Mar.' The references to 'The Dark Interpreter'
in the latter would thus become intelligible,
as the reader is not there in any full sense informed who
the 'Dark Interpreter' was; and the piece, recovered
from his MSS. and now printed, may thus be regarded as
having a special value for De Quincey students, and,
indeed, for readers generally. In <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>
he did indeed interpolate a sentence or two, and these
were reproduced in the American edition of the works
(Fields's); but they are so slight and general compared
with the complete 'Suspiria' now presented, that they
do not in any way detract from its originality and value.</p>

<p>The master-idea of the 'Suspiria' is the power which
lies in suffering, in agony unuttered and unutterable, to
develop the intellect and the spirit of man; to open
these to the ineffable conceptions of the infinite, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
some discernment, otherwise impossible, of the beneficent
might that lies in pain and sorrow. De Quincey
seeks his symbols sometimes in natural phenomena,
oftener in the creation of mighty abstractions; and the
moral of all must be set forth in the burden of 'The
Daughter of Lebanon,' that 'God may give by seeming
to refuse.' Prose-poems, as they have been called, they
are deeply philosophical, presenting under the guise of
phantasy the profoundest laws of the working of the
human spirit in its most terrible disciplines, and asserting
for the darkest phenomena of human life some compensating
elements as awakeners of hope and fear and
awe. The sense of a great pariah world is ever present
with him&mdash;a world of outcasts and of innocents bearing
the burden of vicarious woes; and thus it is that his title
is justified&mdash;<i>Suspiria de Profundis</i>: 'Sighs from the
Depths.'</p>

<p>We find De Quincey writing in his prefatory notice to
the enlarged edition of the 'Confessions' in November,
1856:</p>

<p>'All along I had relied upon a crowning grace, which
I had reserved for the final page of this volume, in a
succession of some twenty or twenty-five dreams and
noon-day visions, which had arisen under the latter
stage of opium influence. These have disappeared;
some under circumstances which allow me a reasonable
prospect of recovering them, some unaccountably, and
some dishonourably. Five or six I believe were burned
in a sudden conflagration which arose from the spark of
a candle falling unobserved amongst a very large pile of
papers in a bedroom, where I was alone and reading.
Falling not <i>on</i>, but amongst and within the papers, the
fire would soon have been ahead of conflict, and, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
communicating with the slight woodwork and draperies
of a bed, it would have immediately enveloped the laths
of the ceiling overhead, and thus the house, far from
fire-engines, would have been burned down in half-an-hour.
My attention was first drawn by a sudden light
upon my book; and the whole difference between a total
destruction of the premises and a trivial loss (from books
charred) of five guineas was due to a large Spanish
cloak. This, thrown over and then drawn down tightly,
by the aid of one sole person, somewhat agitated, but
retaining her presence of mind, effectually extinguished
the fire. Amongst the papers burned partially, but not
so burned as to be absolutely irretrievable, was "The
Daughter of Lebanon," and this I have printed and
have intentionally placed it at the end, as appropriately
closing a record in which the case of poor "Ann the
Outcast" formed not only the most memorable and the
most suggestively pathetic incident, but also <i>that</i> which,
more than any other, coloured&mdash;or (more truly, I should
say) shaped, moulded and remoulded, composed and
decomposed&mdash;the great body of opium dreams.'</p>

<p>After this loss of the greater portion of the 'Suspiria'
copy, De Quincey seems to have become indifferent in
some degree to their continuity and relation to each
other. He drew the 'Affliction of Childhood' and
'Dream Echoes,' which stood early in the order of the
'Suspiria,' into the 'Autobiographic Sketches,' and also
the 'Spectre of the Brocken,' which was meant to come
somewhat later in the series as originally planned; and,
as we have seen, he appended 'The Daughter of Lebanon'
to the 'Opium Confessions,' without any reference, save
in the preface, to its really having formed part of a
separate collection of dreams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>From a list found among his MSS. we are able to give
the arrangement of the whole as it would have appeared
had no accident occurred, and all the papers been at
hand. Those followed by a cross are those which are
now recovered, and those with a dagger what were
reprinted either as 'Suspiria' or otherwise in Messrs.
Black's editions.</p>

<p>Thus of the thirty-two 'Suspiria' intended by the
author, we have only nine that received his final corrections,
and even with those now recovered, we have only
about one half of the whole, presuming that those which
are lost or remained unwritten would have averaged
about the same length as those we have. To those who
have studied the 'Suspiria' as published, how suggestive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
many of these titles will be! 'Count the Leaves in
Vallombrosa'&mdash;what phantasies would that have conjured
up! The lost, the apparently wasted of the leaves
from the tree of human life, and the possibilities of use
and redemption! De Quincey would there doubtless
have given us under a form more or less fanciful or
symbolical his reading of the problem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Why Nature out of fifty seeds<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So often brings but one to bear.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The case of the Cagots, the pariahs of the Pyrenees,
as we know from references elsewhere, excited his
curiosity, as did all of the pariah class, and much
engaged his attention; and in the 'Cagot and Cressida'
'Suspiria' we should probably have had under symbols of
mighty abstractions the vision of the pariah world, and
the world of health and outward fortune which scorns
and excludes the other, and partly, at all events, actively
dooms it to a living death in England of to-day, as in
India of the past, and in Jewry of old, where the leper
was thrust outside the wall to wail 'Unclean! unclean!'</p>


<h3>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Dark Interpreter</span>.</h3>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>'Oh, eternity with outstretched wings, that broodest over the secret
truths in whose roots lie the mysteries of man&mdash;his whence, his
whither&mdash;have I searched thee, and struck a right key on thy dreadful
organ!'</p></div>


<p>Suffering is a mightier agency in the hands of nature,
as a Demiurgus creating the intellect, than most people
are aware of.</p>

<p>The truth I heard often in sleep from the lips of the
Dark Interpreter. Who is he? He is a shadow, reader,
but a shadow with whom you must suffer me to make
you acquainted. You need not be afraid of him, for when
I explain his nature and origin you will see that he is
essentially inoffensive; or if sometimes he menaces with
his countenance, that is but seldom: and then, as his
features in those moods shift as rapidly as clouds in a gale
of wind, you may always look for the terrific aspects to
vanish as fast as they have gathered. As to his origin&mdash;what
it is, I know exactly, but cannot without a little
circuit of preparation make <i>you</i> understand. Perhaps
you are aware of that power in the eye of many children
by which in darkness they project a vast theatre of phantasmagorical
figures moving forwards or backwards between
their bed-curtains and the chamber walls. In
some children this power is semi-voluntary&mdash;they can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
control or perhaps suspend the shows; but in others it is
altogether automatic. I myself, at the date of my last
confessions, had seen in this way more processions&mdash;generally
solemn, mournful, belonging to eternity, but
also at times glad, triumphal pomps, that seemed to
enter the gates of Time&mdash;than all the religions of
paganism, fierce or gay, ever witnessed. Now, there is in
the dark places of the human spirit&mdash;in grief, in fear, in
vindictive wrath&mdash;a power of self-projection not unlike to
this. Thirty years ago, it may be, a man called Symons
committed several murders in a sudden epilepsy of planet-struck
fury. According to my recollection, this case
happened at Hoddesdon, which is in Middlesex. 'Revenge
is sweet!' was his hellish motto on that occasion,
and that motto itself records the abysses which a human
will can open. Revenge is <i>not</i> sweet, unless by the
mighty charm of a charity that seeketh not her own it
has become benignant.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And what he had to revenge
was woman's scorn. He had been a plain farm-servant;
and, in fact, he was executed, as such men often are, on
a proper point of professional respect to their calling, in
a smock-frock, or blouse, to render so ugly a clash of
syllables. His young mistress was every way and by
much his superior, as well in prospects as in education.
But the man, by nature arrogant, and little acquainted
with the world, presumptuously raised his eyes to one of
his young mistresses. Great was the scorn with which
she repulsed his audacity, and her sisters participated in
her disdain. Upon this affront he brooded night and
day; and, after the term of his service was over, and he,
in effect, forgotten by the family, one day he suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>descended amongst the women of the family like an
Avatar of vengeance. Right and left he threw out his
murderous knife without distinction of person, leaving
the room and the passage floating in blood.</p>

<p>The final result of this carnage was not so terrific as it
threatened to be. Some, I think, recovered; but, also,
one, who did <i>not</i> recover, was unhappily a stranger to the
whole cause of his fury. Now, this murderer always
maintained, in conversation with the prison chaplain,
that, as he rushed on in his hellish career, he perceived
distinctly a dark figure on his right hand, keeping pace
with himself. Upon <i>that</i> the superstitious, of course,
supposed that some fiend had revealed himself, and associated
his superfluous presence with the dark atrocity.
Symons was not a philosopher, but my opinion is, that
he was too much so to tolerate that hypothesis, since, if
there was one man in all Europe that needed no tempter
to evil on that evening, it was precisely Mr. Symons, as
nobody knew better than Mr. Symons himself. I had
not the benefit of his acquaintance, or I would have explained
it to him. The fact is, in point of awe a fiend
would be a poor, trivial <i>bagatelle</i> compared to the
shadowy projections, <i>umbras</i> and <i>penumbras</i>, which the
unsearchable depths of man's nature is capable, under
adequate excitement, of throwing off, and even into
stationary forms. I shall have occasion to notice this
point again. There are creative agencies in every part
of human nature, of which the thousandth part could
never be revealed in one life.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />
<p>You have heard, reader, in vision which describes our
Ladies of Sorrow, particularly in the dark admonition of
Madonna, to her wicked sister that hateth and tempteth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
what root of dark uses may lie in moral convulsions:
not the uses hypocritically vaunted by theatrical devotion
which affronts the majesty of God, that ever and in all
things loves Truth&mdash;prefers sincerity that is erring to
piety that cants. Rebellion which is the sin of witchcraft
is more pardonable in His sight than speechifying
resignation, listening with complacency to its own self-conquests.
Show always as much neighbourhood as
thou canst to grief that abases itself, which will cost
thee but little effort if thine own grief hath been great.
But God, who sees thy efforts in secret, will slowly
strengthen those efforts, and make that to be a real deed,
bearing tranquillity for thyself, which at first was but a
feeble wish breathing homage to <i>Him.</i></p>

<p>In after-life, from twenty to twenty-four, on looking back
to those struggles of my childhood, I used to wonder
exceedingly that a child could be exposed to struggles
on such a scale. But two views unfolded upon me as
my experience widened, which took away that wonder.
The first was the vast scale upon which the sufferings of
children are found everywhere expanded in the realities
of life. The generation of infants which you see is but
part of those who belong to it; were born in it; and
make, the world over, not one half of it. The missing
half, more than an equal number to those of any age
that are now living, have perished by every kind of torments.
Three thousand children per annum&mdash;that is,
three hundred thousand per century; that is (omitting
Sundays), about ten every day&mdash;pass to heaven through
flames<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in this very island of Great Britain. And of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>those who survive to reach maturity what multitudes
have fought with fierce pangs of hunger, cold, and nakedness!
When I came to know all this, then reverting my
eye to <i>my</i> struggle, I said oftentimes it was nothing!
Secondly, in watching the infancy of my own children,
I made another discovery&mdash;it is well known to mothers,
to nurses, and also to philosophers&mdash;that the tears and
lamentations of infants during the year or so when they
have no <i>other</i> language of complaint run through a gamut
that is as inexhaustible as the cremona of Paganini. An
ear but moderately learned in that language cannot be
deceived as to the rate and <i>modulus</i> of the suffering
which it indicates. A fretful or peevish cry cannot by
any efforts make itself impassioned. The cry of impatience,
of hunger, of irritation, of reproach, of alarm,
are all different&mdash;different as a chorus of Beethoven from
a chorus of Mozart. But if ever you saw an infant
suffering for an hour, as sometimes the healthiest does,
under some attack of the stomach, which has the tiger-grasp
of the Oriental cholera, then you will hear moans
that address to their mothers an anguish of supplication
for aid such as might storm the heart of Moloch. Once
hearing it, you will not forget it. Now, it was a constant
remark of mine, after any storm of that nature (occurring,
suppose, once in two months), that always on
the following day, when a long, long sleep had chased
away the darkness and the memory of the darkness from
the little creature's brain, a sensible expansion had taken
place in the intellectual faculties of attention, observation,
and animation. It renewed the case of our great
modern poet, who, on listening to the raving of the midnight
storm, and the crashing which it was making in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the mighty woods, reminded himself that all this hell of
trouble</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Tells also of bright calms that shall succeed.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pain driven to agony, or grief driven to frenzy, is essential
to the ventilation of profound natures. A sea which
is deeper than any that Count Massigli<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> measured cannot
be searched and torn up from its sleeping depths without
a levanter or a monsoon. A nature which is profound
in excess, but also introverted and abstracted in excess,
so as to be in peril of wasting itself in interminable reverie,
cannot be awakened sometimes without afflictions
that go to the very foundations, heaving, stirring, yet
finally harmonizing; and it is in such cases that the Dark
Interpreter does his work, revealing the worlds of pain
and agony and woe possible to man&mdash;possible even to
the innocent spirit of a child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<h3>2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Solitude of Childhood.</span></h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>As nothing which is impassioned escapes the eye of
poetry, neither has this escaped it&mdash;that there is, or may
be, through solitude, 'sublime attractions of the grave.'
But even poetry has not perceived that these attractions
may arise for a child. Not, indeed, a passion for the
grave <i>as</i> the grave&mdash;from <i>that</i> a child revolts; but a
passion for the grave as the portal through which it may
recover some heavenly countenance, mother or sister,
that has vanished. Through solitude this passion may
be exalted into a frenzy like a nympholepsy. At first,
when in childhood we find ourselves torn away from the
lips that we could hang on for ever, we throw out our
arms in vain struggles to snatch at them, and pull them
back again. But when we have felt for a time how hopeless
is that effort, and that they cannot come to <i>us</i>, we
desist from that struggle, and next we whisper to our
hearts, Might not we go to <i>them</i>?</p>

<p>Such in principle and origin was the famous <i>Dulce
Domum</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the English schoolboy. Such is the <i>Heimweh</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
(home-sickness) of the German and Swiss soldier in
foreign service. Such is the passion of the Calenture.
Doubtless, reader, you have seen it described. The poor
sailor is in tropical latitudes; deep, breathless calms
have prevailed for weeks. Fever and delirium are upon
him. Suddenly from his restless hammock he starts up;
he will fret no longer in darkness; he ascends upon
deck. How motionless are the deeps! How vast&mdash;how
sweet are these shining zaarrahs of water! He gazes,
and slowly under the blazing scenery of his brain the
scenery of his eye unsettles. The waters are swallowed
up; the seas have disappeared. Green fields appear,
a silent dell, and a pastoral cottage. Two faces appear&mdash;are
at the door&mdash;sweet female faces, and behold they
beckon him. 'Come to us!' they seem to say. The
picture rises to his wearied brain like a <i>sanctus</i> from the
choir of a cathedral, and in the twinkling of an eye,
stung to madness by the cravings of his heart, the man
is overboard. He is gone&mdash;he is lost for this world; but
if he missed the arms of the lovely women&mdash;wife and
sister&mdash;whom he sought, assuredly he has settled into
arms that are mightier and not less indulgent.</p>

<p>I, young as I was, had one feeling not learned from
books, and that <i>could</i> not have been learned from books,
the deepest of all that connect themselves with natural
scenery. It is the feeling which in 'The Hart-leap Well'
of Wordsworth, in his 'Danish Boy,' and other exquisite
poems is brought out, viz., the breathless, mysterious,
Pan-like silence that haunts the noon-day. If there were
winds abroad, then I was roused myself into sympathetic
tumults. But if this dead silence haunted the air, then
the peace which was in nature echoed another peace
which lay in graves, and I fell into a sick languishing for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
things which a voice from heaven seemed to say '<i>cannot</i>
be granted.'</p>

<p>There is a German superstition, which eight or ten
years after I read, of the Erl-king and his daughter. The
daughter had power to tempt infants away into the invisible
world; but it is, as the reader understands, by
collusion with some infirmity of sick desire for such
worlds in the infant itself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Who is that rides through the forest so fast?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a knight who carries his infant upon his saddle-bow.
The Erl-king's daughter rides by his side; and, in
words audible only when she means them to be heard,
she says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If thou wilt, dear baby, with me go away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will see a fine show, we will play a fine play.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That sounds lovely to my ears. Oh yes, that collusion
with dim sleeping infancy is lovely to me; but I was too
advanced in intellect to have been tempted by <i>such</i>
temptations. Still there was a perilous attraction for
me in worlds that slept and rested; and if the Erl-king's
daughter had revealed herself to my perceptions, there
was one 'show' that she might have promised which
would have wiled me away with her into the dimmest
depths of the mightiest and remotest forests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h3>3.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Who is this Woman that beckoneth and warneth
me from the Place where she is, and in whose Eyes
is Woeful Remembrance? I guess who she is.</span></h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>In my dreams were often prefigurements of my future,
as I could not but read the signs. What man has not
some time in dewy morn, or sequestered eve, or in the
still night-watches, when deep sleep falleth on other men
but visiteth not his weary eyelids&mdash;what man, I say, has
not some time hushed his spirit and questioned with himself
whether some things seen or obscurely felt, were not
anticipated as by mystic foretaste in some far halcyon
time, post-natal or ante-natal he knew not; only
assuredly he knew that for him past and present and
future merged in one awful moment of lightning revelation.
Oh, spirit that dwelleth in man, how subtle are <i>thy</i>
revelations; how deep, how delirious the raptures thou
canst inspire; how poignant the stings with which thou
canst pierce the heart; how sweet the honey with which
thou assuagest the wound; how dark the despairs and
accusings that lie behind thy curtains, and leap upon us
like lightning from the cloud, with the sense as of some
heavenly blazoning, and oftentimes carry us beyond ourselves!</p>

<p>It is a sweet morning in June, and the fragrance of the
roses is wafted towards me as I move&mdash;for I am walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in a lawny meadow, still wet with dew&mdash;and a wavering
mist lies over the distance. Suddenly it seems to lift,
and out of the dewy dimness emerges a cottage, embowered
with roses and clustering clematis; and the
hills, in which it is set like a gem, are tree-clad, and rise
billowy behind it, and to the right and to the left are
glistening expanses of water. Over the cottage there
hangs a halo, as if clouds had but parted there. From
the door of that cottage emerges a figure, the countenance
full of the trepidation of some dread woe feared or
remembered. With waving arm and tearful uplifted face
the figure first beckons me onward, and then, when I have
advanced some yards, frowning, warns me away. As I
still continue to advance, despite the warning, darkness
falls: figure, cottage, hills, trees, and halo fade and disappear;
and all that remains to me is the look on the
face of her that beckoned and warned me away. I read
that glance as by the inspiration of a moment. We had
been together; together we had entered some troubled
gulf; struggled together, suffered together. Was it as
lovers torn asunder by calamity? was it as combatants
forced by bitter necessity into bitter feud, when we only,
in all the world, yearned for peace together? Oh, what
a searching glance was that which she cast on me! as if
she, being now in the spiritual world, abstracted from
flesh, remembered things that I could not remember.
Oh, how I shuddered as the sweet sunny eyes in the
sweet sunny morning of June&mdash;the month that was my
'angelical'; half spring, yet with summer dress, that to
me was very 'angelical'&mdash;seemed reproachfully to challenge
in me recollections of things passed thousands of
years ago (old indeed, yet that were made new again for
us, because now first it was that we met again). Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
heavens! it came over me as doth the raven over the infected
house, as from a bed of violets sweeps the saintly
odour of corruption. What a glimpse was thus revealed!
glory in despair, as of that gorgeous vegetation that hid
the sterilities of the grave in the tropics of that summer
long ago; of that heavenly beauty which slept side by
side within my sister's coffin in the month of June; of
those saintly swells that rose from an infinite distance&mdash;I
know not whether to or from my sister. Could this be
a memorial of that nature? Are the nearer and more
distant stages of life thus dimly connected, and the connection
hidden, but suddenly revealed for a moment?</p>

<p>This lady for years appeared to me in dreams; in that,
considering the electric character of my dreams, and that
they were far less like a lake reflecting the heavens than
like the pencil of some mighty artist&mdash;Da Vinci or
Michael Angelo&mdash;that cannot copy in simplicity, but
comments in freedom, while reflecting in fidelity, there
was nothing to surprise. But a change in this appearance
was remarkable. Oftentimes, after eight years had
passed, she appeared in summer dawn at a window. It
was a window that opened on a balcony. This feature
only gave a distinction, a refinement, to the aspect of the
cottage&mdash;else all was simplicity. Spirit of Peace, dove-like
dawn that slept upon the cottage, ye were not broken
by any participation in my grief and despair! For ever
the vision of that cottage was renewed. Did I roam in
the depths of sweet pastoral solitudes in the West, with
the tinkling of sheep-bells in my ears, a rounded hillock,
seen vaguely, would shape itself into a cottage; and at
the door my monitory, regretful Hebe would appear.
Did I wander by the seashore, one gently-swelling wave
in the vast heaving plain of waters would suddenly trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>form
itself into a cottage, and I, by some involuntary
inward impulse, would in fancy advance toward it.</p>

<p>Ah, reader, you will think this which I am going to say
too near, too holy, for recital. But not so. The deeper
a woe touches me in heart, so much the more am I urged
to recite it. The world disappears: I see only the grand
reliques of a world&mdash;memorials of a love that has departed,
has been&mdash;the record of a sorrow that is, and has its
greyness converted into verdure&mdash;monuments of a wrath
that has been reconciled, of a wrong that has been atoned
for&mdash;convulsions of a storm that has gone by. What I
am going to say is the most like a superstitious thing
that I ever shall say. And I have reason to think that
every man who is not a villain once in his life must be
superstitious. It is a tribute which he pays to human
frailty, which tribute if he will not pay, which frailty if
he will not share, then also he shall not have any of its
strength.</p>

<p>The face of this monitory Hebe haunted me for some
years in a way that I must faintly attempt to explain.
It is little to say that it was the sweetest face, with the
most peculiar expression of sweetness, that I had ever
seen: that was much, but that was earthly. There was
something more terrific, believe me, than this; yet that
was not the word: terror looks to the future; and this
perhaps did, but not primarily. Chiefly it looked at some
unknown past, and was for that reason awful; yes,
awful&mdash;that was the word.</p>

<p>Thus, on any of those heavenly sunny mornings, that
now are buried in an endless grave, did I, transported by
no human means, enter that cottage, and descend to
that breakfast-room, my earliest salute was to her, that
ever, as the look of pictures do, with her eyes pursued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
me round the room, and oftentimes with a subtle checking
of grief, as if great sorrow had been or would be hers.
And it was, too, in the sweet Maytime. Oh yes; she
was but as if she had been&mdash;as if it were her original
... chosen to have been the aurora of a heavenly clime;
and then suddenly she was as one of whom, for some
thousand years, Paradise had received no report; then,
again, as if she entered the gates of Paradise not less innocent;
and, again, as if she could not enter; and some
blame&mdash;but I knew not what blame&mdash;was mine; and
now she looked as though broken with a woe that no
man could read, as she sought to travel back to her early
joy&mdash;yet no longer a joy that is sublime in innocency, but
a joy from which sprung abysses of memories polluted into
anguish, till her tears seemed to be suffused with drops of
blood. All around was peace and the deep silence of untroubled
solitude; only in the lovely lady was a sign of
horror, that had slept, under deep ages of frost, in her
heart, and now rose, as with the rushing of wings, to her
face. Could it be supposed that one life&mdash;so pitiful a
thing&mdash;was what moved her care? Oh no; it was, or it
seemed, as if this poor wreck of a life happened to be that
one which determined the fate of some thousand others.
Nothing less; nothing so abject as one poor fifty years&mdash;nothing
less than a century of centuries could have
stirred the horror that rose to her lovely lips, as once
more she waved me away from the cottage.</p>

<p>Oh, reader, five years after I saw that sweet face in
reality&mdash;saw it in the flesh; saw that pomp of womanhood;
saw that cottage; saw a thousand times that
lovely domicile that heard the cooing of the solitary dove
in the solitary morning; saw the grace of childhood and
the shadows of graves that lay, like creatures asleep, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the sunshine; saw, also, the horror, somehow realized as
a shadowy reflection from myself, which warned me off
from that cottage, and which still rings through the
dreams of five-and-twenty years.</p>

<br />
<p>The general sentiment or sense of pre-existence, of
which this <i>Suspiria</i> may be regarded as one significant
and affecting illustration, had this record in the outset of
the 'Reminiscences of Wordsworth':</p>

<p>'Oh, sense of mysterious pre-existence, by which,
through years, in which as yet a stranger to those valleys
of Westmoreland, I viewed myself as a phantom self&mdash;a
second identity projected from my own consciousness,
and already living amongst them&mdash;how was it, and by
what prophetic instinct, that already I said to myself
oftentimes, when chasing day-dreams along the pictures
of these wild mountainous labyrinths, which as yet I had
not traversed, "Here, in some distant year, I shall be
shaken with love, and there with stormiest grief and
regret"? Whence was it that sudden revelations came
upon me, like the drawings up of a curtain, and closing
again as rapidly, of scenes that made the future heaven
of my life? And how was it that in thought I <i>was</i>, and
yet in reality <i>was not</i>, a denizen, already, in 1803, 1804,
1805, of lakes and forest lawns, which I never saw till
1807? and that, by a prophetic instinct of heart, I rehearsed
and lived over, as it were, in vision those chapters
of my life which have carried with them the weightiest
burden of joy and sorrow, and by the margin of those
very lakes and hills with which I prefigured this connection?
and, in short, that for me, by a transcendent
privilege, during the novitiate of my life, most truly I
might say:</p>

<h3>4.&mdash;THE PRINCESS WHO OVERLOOKED ONE SEED IN A
POMEGRANATE.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>There is a story told in the 'Arabian Nights' of a princess
who, by overlooking one seed of a pomegranate, precipitated
the event which she had laboured to make impossible.
She lies in wait for the event which she foresees.
The pomegranate swells, opens, splits; the seeds, which
she knows to be roots of evil, rapidly she swallows; but
one&mdash;only one&mdash;before it could be arrested, rolls away
into a river. It is lost! it is irrecoverable! She has
triumphed, but she must perish. Already she feels the
flames mounting up which are to consume her, and she
calls for water hastily&mdash;not to deliver herself (for that is
impossible), but, nobly forgetting her own misery, that
she may prevent that destruction of her brother mortal
which had been the original object for hazarding her own.
Yet why go to Arabian fictions? Even in our daily life
is exhibited, in proportions far more gigantic, that tendency
to swell and amplify itself into mountains of darkness,
which exists oftentimes in germs that are imperceptible.
An error in human choice, an infirmity in the
human will, though it were at first less than a mote,
though it should swerve from the right line by an interval
less than any thread</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That ever spider twisted from her womb,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>sometimes begins to swell, to grow, to widen its distance
rapidly, travels off into boundless spaces remote from the
true centre, spaces incalculable and irretraceable, until
hope seems extinguished and return impossible. Such
was the course of my own opium career. Such is the
history of human errors every day. Such was the
original sin of the Greek theories on Deity, which could
not have been healed but by putting off their own nature,
and kindling into a new principle&mdash;absolutely undiscoverable,
as I contend, for the Grecian intellect.</p>

<p>Oftentimes an echo goes as it were to sleep: the series
of reverberations has died away. Suddenly a second
series awakens: this subsides, then a third wakens up.
So of actions done in youth. After great tumults all is
quieted. You dream that they are over. In a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, on some fatal morning in
middle-life the far-off consequences come back upon you.
And you say to yourself, 'Oh, Heaven, if I had fifty lives
this crime would reappear, as Pelion upon Ossa!' So
was it with my affection. Left to natural peace, I might
have conquered it: <i>Verschmerzeon.</i> To charm it down by
the mere suffering of grief, to hush it by endurance, that
was the natural policy&mdash;that was the natural process.
But behold! A new form of sorrow arises, and the two
multiply together. And the worm which was beginning
to fall asleep is roused again to pestilential fierceness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h3>5.&mdash;NOTES FOR 'SUSPIRIA.'</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Mystery unfathomable of Death! Mystery unapproachable
of God! Destined it was, from the foundations
of the world, that each mystery should make war
upon the other: once that the lesser mystery should
swallow up for a moment a <i>limbus</i> of the greater; and
that woe is past: once that the greater mystery should
swallow up for ever the whole vortex of the lesser; and
that glory is yet to come. After which man, that is the
son of God, shall lift up his eyes for ever, saying, 'Behold!
these were two mysteries; and one is not; and
there is but one mystery that survives for ever!'</p>

<br />
<p>If an eternity (Death supposed) is as vast as a star, yet
the most miserable of earthly blocks not four feet square
will eclipse, masque, hide it from centre to circumference.
And so it really is. Incredible as it might seem apart
from experience, the dreadful reality of death is utterly
withdrawn from us because itself dwindles to an apparent
mote, and the perishing non-reality thickens into a darkness
as massy as a rock.</p>

<br />
<p>Great changes summon to great meditations. Daily
we see the most joyous of events take a colouring of
solemnity from the mere relation in which they stand to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
an uncertain future: the birth of a child, heir to the
greatest expectations, and welcomed clamorously by the
sympathy of myriads, speaks to the more reflecting in an
undertone of monitory sadness, were it only as a tribute
to the frailty of human expectations: and a marriage-day,
of all human events the most lawfully festal, yet
needs something of effort to chase away the boding sadness
which settles unavoidably upon any new career; the
promise is vague, but new hopes have created new
dangers, and responsibilities contracted perhaps with
rapture are charged with menace.</p>

<br />
<p>For every one of us, male or female, there is a year of
crisis&mdash;a year of solemn and conscious transition, a year
in which the light-hearted sense of the <i>irresponsible</i>
ceases to gild the heavenly dawn. A year there is,
settled by no law or usage, for me perhaps the eighteenth,
for you the seventeenth, for another the nineteenth,
within the gates of which, underneath the gloomy archway
of which, sits a phantom of yourself.</p>

<br />
<p>Turn a screw, tighten a linch-pin&mdash;which is not to
disease, but perhaps to exalt, the mighty machinery of
the brain&mdash;and the Infinities appear, before which the
tranquillity of man unsettles, the gracious forms of life
depart, and the ghostly enters. So profoundly is this
true, that oftentimes I have said of my own tremendous
experience in this region&mdash;destined too certainly, I fear,
finally to swallow up intellect and the life of life in the
heart, unless God of His mercy fetches me away by some
sudden death&mdash;that death, considered as an entrance to
this ghostly world, is but a postern-gate by comparison
with the heaven-aspiring vestibule through which this
world of the Infinite introduces the ghostly world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p>Time, if it does not diminish grief, alters its character.
At first we stretch out our hands in very blindness of
heart, as if trying to draw back again those whom we
have lost. But, after a season, when the impotence of
such efforts has become too sensibly felt, finding that
they will not come back to us, a strange fascination
arises which yearns after some mode of going to <i>them.</i>
There is a gulf fixed which childhood rarely can pass.
But we link our wishes with whatsoever would gently
waft us over. We stretch out our hands, and say,
'Sister, lend us thy help, and plead for us with God,
that we may pass over without much agony.'</p>

<br />
<p>The joy of an infant, or joy-generation, without significance
to an unprofound and common mind&mdash;how strange
to see the excess of pathos in that; yet men of any (or
at least of much) sensibility see in this a transpicuous
masque for another form, viz., the eternal ground of sorrow
in all human hearts. This, by the way, in an essay on
William Wordsworth, should be noticed as the charm of
his poetry; and the note differential, in fact. At least, I
know not of any former poet who has so systematically
sought his sadness in the very luxury of joy. Thus, in
the 'Two April Mornings,' 'what a mortal freshness of
dewy radiance! what an attraction of early summer!
what a vision of roses in June! Yet it is all transmuted
to a purpose of sadness.'</p>

<br />
<p>Ah, reader, scorn not that which&mdash;whether you refuse
it or not as the reality of realities&mdash;is assuredly the
reality of dreams, linking us to a far vaster cycle, in
which the love and the languishing, the ruin and the
horror, of this world are but moments&mdash;but elements in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
an eternal circle. The cycle stretches from an East that
is forgotten to a West that is but conjectured. The mere
fact of your own individual calamity is a life; the
tragedy is a nature; the hope is but as a dim augury
written on a flower.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<br />
<p>If the things that have fretted us had not some art
for retiring into secret oblivion, what a hell would life
become! Now, understand how in some nervous derangements
this horror really takes place. Some things
that had sunk into utter forgetfulness, others that had
faded into visionary power, all rise as gray phantoms
from the dust; the field of our earthly combats that
should by rights have settled into peace, is all alive with
hosts of resurrections&mdash;cavalries that sweep in gusty
charges&mdash;columns that thunder from afar&mdash;arms gleaming
through clouds of sulphur.</p>

<br />
<p>God takes care for the religion of little children wheresoever
His Christianity exists. Wheresoever there is a
national Church established, to which a child sees all his
protectors resort; wheresoever he beholds amongst earthly
creatures whom most he honours prostrate in devotion
before these illimitable heavens, which fill to overflowing
the total capacities of his young adoring heart; wheresoever
at intervals he beholds the sleep of death, falling
upon the men or women whom he has seen&mdash;a depth
stretching as far below his power to fathom as those
persons ascend beyond his powers to pursue&mdash;God
speaks to their hearts by dreams and their tumultuous
grandeurs. Even by solitude does God speak to little
children, when made vocal by the services of Christianity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>as also he does by darkness wheresoever it is peopled
with visions of His almighty power. For a pagan child,
for a Greek child, solitude was nothing; for a Christian
child it is made the power of God, and the hieroglyphic
of His most distant truth. The solitude in life is deep
for the millions who have none to love them, and deep
for those who suffer by secret and incommunicable woe
and have none to pity them. Thus, be you assured that
though infancy talks least of that which slumbers
deepest, it yet rests in its own transcendent solitude.
But infancy, you say, talks surely most of that which
is uppermost in its heart. Yes, doubtless of that which
is uppermost, but not at all of that which slumbers
below the foundations of its heart.</p>

<p>[And then follows a suggestion to put in a note:]</p>

<br />
<p>I except one case, the case of any child who is
marked for death by organic disease, and knows it. In
such cases the creature is changed&mdash;that which would
have been unchildlike ceases to offend, for a new character
is forming.</p>

<h2><i>II. THE LOVELIEST SIGHT FOR WOMAN'S EYES.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The loveliest sight that a woman's eye opens upon in
this world is her first-born child; and the holiest sight
upon which the eyes of God settle in Almighty sanction
and perfect blessing is the love which soon kindles between
the mother and her infant: mute and speechless
on the one side, with no language but tears and kisses
and looks. Beautiful is the philosophy ... which
arises out of that reflection or passion connected with
the transition that has produced it. First comes the
whole mighty drama of love, purified<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ever more and
more, how often from grosser feelings, yet of necessity
through its very elements, oscillating between the finite
and the infinite: the haughtiness of womanly pride, so
dignified, yet not always free from the near contagion of
error; the romance so ennobling, yet not always entirely
reasonable; the tender dawn of opening sentiments,
pointing to an idea in all this which it neither can reach
nor could long sustain. Think of the great storm of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>agitation, and fear and hope, through which, in her
earliest days of womanhood, every woman must naturally
pass, fulfilling a law of her Creator, yet a law which
rests upon her mixed constitution; animal, though indefinitely
ascending to what is non-animal&mdash;as a
daughter of man, frail ... and imperfect, yet also as
a daughter of God, standing erect, with eyes to the
heavens. Next, when the great vernal passover of
sexual tenderness and romance has fulfilled its purpose,
we see, rising as a Ph&#339;nix from this great mystery of
ennobled instincts, another mystery, much more profound,
more affecting, more divine&mdash;not so much a
rapture as a blissful repose of a Sabbath, which swallows
up the more perishing story of the first; forcing
the vast heart of female nature through stages of ascent,
forcing it to pursue the transmigrations of the Psyche
from the aurelic condition, so glowing in its colour, into
the winged creature which mixes with the mystery of
the dawn, and ascends to the altar of the infinite
heavens, rising by a ladder of light from that sympathy
which God surveys with approbation; and even more
so as He beholds it self-purifying under His Christianity
to that sympathy which needs no purification,
but is the holiest of things on this earth, and that in
which God most reveals Himself through the nature
of humanity.</p>

<p>Well is it for the glorification of human nature that
through these the vast majority of women must for ever
pass; well also that, by placing its sublime germs near
to female youth, God thus turns away by anticipation
the divinest of disciplines from the rapacious absorption
of the grave. Time is found&mdash;how often&mdash;for those
who are early summoned into rendering back their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
glorious privilege, who yet have tasted in its first-fruits
the paradise of maternal love.</p>

<p>And pertaining also to this part of the subject, I will
tell you a result of my own observations of no light
importance to women.</p>

<p>It is this: Nineteen times out of twenty I have remarked
that the true paradise of a female life in all
ranks, not too elevated for constant intercourse with the
children, is by no means the years of courtship, nor
the earliest period of marriage, but that sequestered
chamber of her experience, in which a mother is left
alone through the day, with servants perhaps in a distant
part of the house, and (God be thanked!) chiefly where
there are no servants at all, she is attended by one sole
companion, her little first-born angel, as yet clinging
to her robe, imperfectly able to walk, still more imperfect
in its prattling and innocent thoughts, clinging to her,
haunting her wherever she goes as her shadow, catching
from her eye the total inspiration of its little palpitating
heart, and sending to hers a thrill of secret pleasure so
often as its little fingers fasten on her own. Left alone
from morning to night with this one companion, or even
with three, still wearing the graces of infancy; buds of
various stages upon the self-same tree, a woman, if she
has the great blessing of approaching such a luxury of
paradise, is moving&mdash;too often not aware that she is
moving&mdash;through the divinest section of her life. As
evening sets in, the husband, through all walks of life,
from the highest professional down to that of common
labour, returns home to vary her modes of conversation
by such thoughts and interests as are more consonant
with his more extensive capacities of intellect. But by
that time her child (or her children) will be reposing on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the little couch, and in the morning, duly as the sun
ascends in power, she sees before her a long, long day of
perfect pleasure in this society which evening will bring
to her, but which is interwoven with every fibre of her
sensibilities. This condition of noiseless, quiet love is
that, above all, which God blesses and smiles upon.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> How purified? And if it should be answered, through and under
Christianity, the fool in his heart would scoff and say: 'What woman
thinks of religion in her youthful courtship?' No; but it is not what
she thinks of, but what thinks of her; not what she contemplates in
consciousness, but what contemplates her, and reaches her by a necessity
of social (? ideal) action. Romance is the product of Christianity,
but so is sentiment.</p></div>

<h2><i>III. WHY THE PAGANS COULD NOT INVEST
THEIR GODS WITH ANY IOTA OF GRANDEUR.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>It is not for so idle a purpose as that of showing the
Pagan backsliding&mdash;that is too evident&mdash;but for a far
subtler purpose, and one which no man has touched, viz.,
the incapacity of creating grandeur for the Pagans, even
with <i>carte blanche</i> in their favour, that I write this paper.
Nothing is more incomprehensible than the following fact&mdash;nothing
than this when mastered and understood is
more thoroughly instructive&mdash;the fact that having a wide,
a limitless field open before them, free to give and to take
away at their own pleasure, the Pagans could not invest
their Gods with any iota of grandeur. Diana, when you
translate her into the Moon, then indeed partakes in all
the <i>natural</i> grandeur of a planet associated with a
dreamy light, with forests, forest lawns, etc., or the wild
accidents of a huntress. But the Moon and the Huntress
are surely not the creations of Pagans, nor indebted to
them for anything but the murderous depluming which
Pagan mythology has operated upon all that is in earth or
in the waters that are under the earth. Now, why could
not the ancients raise one little scintillating glory in behalf
of their monstrous deities? So far are they from thus
raising Jupiter, that he is sometimes made the ground of
nature (not, observe, for any positive reason that they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for any relation that Jupiter had to Creation, but simply
for the negative reason that they had nobody else)&mdash;never
does Jupiter seem more disgusting than when as just
now in a translation of the 'Batrachia' I read that Jupiter
had given to frogs an amphibious nature, making the
awful, ancient, first-born secrets of Chaos to be his, and
thus forcing into contrast and remembrance his odious
personality.</p>

<p>Why, why, why could not the Romans, etc., make a
grandeur for their Gods? Not being able to make them
grand, they daubed them with finery. All that people
imagine in the Jupiter Olympus of Phidias&mdash;<i>they</i>
themselves confer. But an apostle is beyond their
reach.</p>

<p>When, be it well observed, the cruel and dark religions
are far more successful than those of Greece and Rome,
for Osiris, etc., by the might of the devil, of darkness,
are truly terrific. Cybele stands as a middle term half-way
between these dark forms and the Greek or Roman.
Pluto is the very model of a puny attempt at darkness
utterly failing. He looks big; he paints himself histrionically;
he soots his face; he has a masterful dog,
nothing half so fearful as a wolf-dog or bloodhound; and
he raises his own <i>manes</i>, poor, stridulous Struldbrugs.</p>

<p>Vainly did the ancient Pagans fight against this fatal
weakness.</p>

<p>They may confer upon their Gods glittering titles of
'ambrosial,' 'immortal'; but the human mind is careless
of positive assertion, and of clamorous iteration in however
angry a tone, when silently it observes stealing out
of facts already conceded some fatal consequence at war
with all these empty pretensions&mdash;mortal even in <i>the
virtual</i> conceptions of the Pagans. If the Pagan Gods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
were really immortal, if essentially they repelled the
touch of mortality, and not through the adulatory
homage of their worshippers causing their true aspects
to unsettle or altogether to disappear in clouds of incense,
then how came whole dynasties of Gods to pass
away, and no man could tell whither? If really they
defied the grave, then how was it that age and the infirmities
of age passed upon them like the shadow of
eclipse upon the golden faces of the planets? If Apollo
were a beardless young man, his father was not such&mdash;<i>he</i>
was in the vigour of maturity; maturity is a flattering
term for expressing it, but it means <i>past youth</i>&mdash;and his
grandfather was superannuated. But even this grandfather,
who <i>had</i> been once what Apollo was now, could
not pretend to more than a transitory station in the long
succession of Gods. Other dynasties, known even to
man, there had been before his; and elder dynasties
before <i>that</i>, of whom only rumours and suspicions survived.
Even this taint, however, this <i>direct</i> access of
mortality, was less shocking to my mind in after-years
than the abominable fact of its reflex or indirect access
in the shape of grief for others who had died. I need
not multiply instances; they are without end. The
reader has but to throw his memory back upon the
anguish of Jupiter, in the 'Iliad,' for the approaching
death of his son Sarpedon, and his vain struggles to deliver
himself from this ghastly net; or upon Thetis,
fighting against the vision of her matchless Pelides
caught in the same vortex; or upon the Muse in
Euripides, hovering in the air and wailing over her young
Rhesus, her brave, her beautiful one, of whom she
trusted that he had been destined to confound the
Grecian host. What! a God, and liable to the pollution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of grief! A Goddess, and standing every hour within
the peril of that dismal shadow!</p>

<p>Here in one moment mark the recoil, the intolerable
recoil, upon the Pagan mind, of that sting which vainly
they pretended to have conquered on behalf of their
Pantheon. Did the reader fancy that I was fatiguing
myself with any task so superfluous as that of proving
the Gods of the heathen to be no Gods? In that case
he has not understood me. My object is to show that
the ancients, that even the Greeks, could not support
the idea of immortality. The idea crumbled to pieces
under their touch. In realizing that idea unconsciously,
they suffered elements to slip in which defeated its very
essence in the result; and not by accident: other elements
they could not have found. Doubtless an insolent
Grecian philosopher would say, 'Surely, I knew that
immortality meant the being liberated from mortality.'
Yes, but this is no more than the negative idea, and the
demand is to give the affirmative idea. Or perhaps I
shall better explain my meaning by substituting other
terms with my own illustration of their value. I say,
then, that the Greek idea of immortality involves only
the nominal idea, not the real idea. Now, the nominal
idea (or, which is the same thing, the nominal definition)
is that which simply sketches the outline of an object in
the shape of a problem; whereas the real definition fills
up that outline and solves that problem. The nominal
definition states the conditions under which an object
would be realized for the mind; the real definition
executes those conditions. The nominal definition, that
I may express it most briefly and pointedly, puts a <i>question</i>;
the real definition <i>answers</i> that question. Thus,
to give our illustration, the insoluble problem of squaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the circle presents us with a good nominal idea. There
is no vagueness at all in the idea of such a square; it is
that square which, when a given circle is laid before you,
would present the same superficial contents in such exquisite
truth of repetition that the eye of God could detect
no shadow of more or of less. Nothing can be
plainer than the demand&mdash;than the question. But as
to the answer, as to the <i>real</i> conditions under which this
demand can be realized, all the wit of man has not been
able to do more than approach it. Or, again, the idea
of a <i>perfect commonwealth</i>, clear enough as a nominal
idea, is in its infancy as a real idea. Or, perhaps, a still
more lively illustration to some readers may be the idea
of <i>perpetual motion.</i> Nominally&mdash;that is, as an idea
sketched problem-wise&mdash;what is plainer? You are required
to assign some principle of motion such that it
shall revolve through the parts of a mechanism self-sustained.
Suppose those parts to be called by the
names of our English alphabet, and to stand in the order
of our alphabet, then A is through B C D, etc., to pass
down with its total power upon Z, which reciprocally is
to come round undiminished upon A B C, etc., for ever.
Never was a <i>nominal</i> definition of what you want more
simple and luminous. But coming to the <i>real</i> definition,
and finding that every letter in succession must still give
something less than is received&mdash;that O, for instance,
cannot give to P all which it received from N&mdash;then no
matter for the triviality of the loss in each separate case,
always it is gathering and accumulating; your hands
drop down in despair; you feel that a principle of death
pervades the machinery; retard it you may, but come it
will at last. And a proof remains behind, as your only
result, that whilst the nominal definition may sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
run before the real definition for ages, and yet finally be
overtaken by it, in other cases the one flies hopelessly
before the pursuit of the other, defies it, and never <i>will</i>
be overtaken to the end of time.</p>

<p>That fate, that necessity, besieged the Grecian idea of
immortality. Rise from forgotten dust, my Plato;
Stagyrite, stand up from the grave; Anaxagoras, with
thy bright, cloudless intellect that searched the skies,
Heraclitus, with thy gloomy, mysterious intellect that
fathomed the deeps, come forward and execute for me
this demand. How shall that immortality, which you
give, which you <i>must</i> give as a trophy of honour to your
Pantheon, sustain itself against the blights from those
humanities which also, by an equal necessity, starting
from your basis, give you must to that Pantheon? How
will you prevent the sad reflux of that tide which finally
engulfs all things under any attempt to execute the
nominal idea of a Deity? You cannot do it. Weave
your divinities in that Grecian loom of yours, and no
skill in the workmanship, nor care that wisdom can
devise, will ever cure the fatal flaws in the texture: for
the mortal taint lies not so much in your work as in the
original errors of your loom.</p>

<h2><i>IV. ON PAGAN SACRIFICES.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Ask any well-informed man at random what he
supposes to have been done with the sacrifices, he will
answer that really he never thought about it, but that
naturally he supposes the flesh was burnt upon the
altars. Not at all, reader; a sacrifice to the Gods
meant universally a banquet to man. He who gave a
splendid public dinner announced in other words that
he designed to celebrate a sacrificial rite. This was of
course. He, on the other hand, who announced a
sacrificial pomp did in other words proclaim by sound of
trumpet that he gave a dinner. This was of necessity.
Hence, when Agamemnon offers a hecatomb to Jupiter,
his brother Menelaus walks in to dinner, <ins class="mycorr" title="hachl&ecirc;tos">&#7937;&#967;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;,</ins>
without invitation. As a brother, we are told by Homer
that no invitation was required. He had the privilege
of what in German is beautifully called 'ein Kind des
Hauses,' a child of the house. This dispensation from
the necessity of a formal invitation Homer explains, but
as to explanation how he knew that there was a dinner,
that he passes over as superfluous. A vast herd of oxen
could not be sacrificed without open and public display of
the preparation, and that a human banquet must accompany
a divine sacrifice&mdash;this was so much a self-evident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
truth that Homer does not trouble himself to make so
needless an explanation.</p>

<p>Hence, therefore, a case of legislation in St. Paul's
Christian administration, which I will venture to say
few readers understand. Take the Feast of Ephesus.
Here, as in all cities of Asia Minor and Greece, the Jews
lived in great numbers. The universal hospitality over
all these regions was exhibited in dinners (<ins class="mycorr" title="dehipna">&#948;&#949;&#7985;&#960;&#957;&#945;</ins>).
Now, it happened not sometimes, but always, that he
who gave a dinner had on the same day made a sacrifice
at the Great Temple; nay, the dinner was always part
of the sacrifice, and thus the following dilemma arose.
Scruples of eating part of sacrifices were absolutely
unintelligible, except as insults to Ephesus. To deny the
existence of Diana had no meaning in the ears of an
Ephesian. All that he did understand was, that if you
happened to be a hater of Ephesus, you must hate the
guardian deity of Ephesus. And the sole inference he
could collect from your refusing to eat what had been
hallowed to Diana was&mdash;that you hated Ephesus. The
dilemma, therefore, was this: either grant a toleration
of this practice, or else farewell to all amicable intercourse
for the Jews with the citizens. In fact, it was to
proclaim open war if this concession were refused. A
scruple of conscience might have been allowed for, but
a scruple of this nature could find no allowance in
any Pagan city whatever. Moreover, it had really no
foundation. The truth is far otherwise than that Pagan
deities were dreams. Far from it. They were as real
as any other beings. The accommodation, therefore,
which St. Paul most wisely granted was&mdash;to eat socially,
without regard to any ceremony through which the food
might have passed. So long as the Judaizing Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
was no party to the religious ceremonies, he was free
of all participation in idolatry. Since if the mere open
operation of a Pagan process could transform into the
character of an accomplice one who with no assenting
heart ate of the food, in that case Christ Himself might
by possibility have shared in an idolatrous banquet, and
we Christians at this day in the East Indies might for
months together become unconscious accomplices in the
foul idolatries of the Buddhist and Brahminical superstitions.</p>

<p>But so essentially were the convivial banquets of the
Pagans interwoven with their religious rites, so essentially
was a great dinner a great offering to the Gods, and
<i>vice vers&acirc;</i>&mdash;a great offering to the Gods a great dinner&mdash;that
the very ministers and chief agents in religion were
at first the same. Cocus, or <ins class="mycorr" title="mageirost">&#956;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;</ins>, was the very same
person as the Pope, or presiding arbiter in succession to
a Pope. 'Sunt eadem,' says Casaubon, 'Cocus et Pope.'
And of this a most striking example is yet extant in
Athen&aelig;us. From the correspondence which for many
centuries was extant between Alexander the Great, when
embarked upon his great expeditions, and his royal
mother Olympias, who remained in Macedon, was one
from which we have an extract even at this day, where;
he, as we learn from the letter quoted, had been urging
his mother to purchase for him a good cook. And what
was made the test supreme of his skill? Why, this, that
he should be <ins class="mycorr" title="thysih&ocirc;n hempeirost">&#952;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#8033;&#957; &#7953;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#964;</ins>, an artist able to dress a
sacrificial banquet. What he meant is this: I do not
want an ordinary cook, who might be equal to the
preparation of a plain (or, what is the same thing,
secular) dinner, but a person qualified or competent to
take charge of a hecatomb dinner. His mother's reply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
addresses itself to that one point only: <ins class="mycorr" title="Peligua ton mageiron
labe hapd th&ecirc;st m&ecirc;trost">&#928;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#947;&#965;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#957;
&#955;&#945;&#946;&#949; &#7937;&#960;&#948; &#952;&#951;&#963;&#964; &#956;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#963;&#964;</ins>, which is in effect: 'A cook is it that
you want? Why, then, you cannot do better than take
mine. The man is a reliable table of sacrifices; he
knows the whole ritual of those great official and sacred
dinners given by the late king, your father. He is
acquainted with the whole <i>cuisine</i> of the more mysterious
religions, the Orgiacs' (probably from the neighbouring
Thrace), 'and all the great ceremonies and observances
practised at Olympia, and even what you may eat on the
great St. Leger Day. So don't lose sight of the arrangement,
but take the man as a present, from me, your
affectionate mother, and be sure to send off an express
for him at your earliest convenience.'</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Professor Robertson Smith in his latest work has well
pointed out that even with the Hebrews the sacrifices
were eaten in common till the seventh century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
when the sin-offerings, in a time of great national
distress, came to be slain before Jehovah, and 'none but
the priests ate of the flesh,' a phase of sacrificial specialization
which marks the beginning of the exclusive
sacerdotalism of the Jews.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h2><i>V. ON THE MYTHUS.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>That which the tradition of the people is to the truth
of facts&mdash;that is a <i>mythus</i> to the reasonable origin of
things. <ins class="mycorr" title="original is vertical">...&deg;</ins> These objects to an eye at <sub>&deg;</sub> might all
melt into one another, as stars are confluent which
modern astronomy has prismatically split. Says Rennell,
as a reason for a Mahometan origin of a canal through
Cairo, such is the tradition of the people. But we
see amongst ourselves how great works are ascribed to the
devil or to the Romans by antiquarians. In Rennell we
see the effects of synthesis. He throws back his observations,
like a woman threading a series of needles or
a shuttle running through a series of rings, through a
succession of Egyptian canals (p. 478), showing the real
action of the case, that a tendency existed to this. And,
by the way, here comes another strong illustration of the
popular adulterations. They in our country confound
the 'Romans,' a vulgar expression for the Roman
Catholics, with the ancient national people of Rome.
Here one element of a <i>mythus</i> B has melted into the
<i>mythus</i> X, and in far-distant times might be very
perplexing to antiquarians, when the popular tradition
was too old for them to <i>see</i> the point of juncture where
the alien stream had fallen in.</p>

<p>Then, again, not only ignorance, but love, combines to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
adulterate the tradition. Every man wishes to give his
own country an interest in anything great. What an
effort has been made to suck Sir T. R. back into
Scotland!</p>

<p>Thus, it is too difficult without a motive to hold apart
vast distances <i>or</i> intervals that lie in a field which has all
gathered into a blue haze. Stars, divided by millions of
miles, collapse into each other. So <i>mythi</i>: and then
comes the perplexity&mdash;the entanglement. Then come
also, from lacun&aelig; arising in these interwelded stories,
temptations to falsehood. By the way, even the recent
tale of Astyages seems to have been pieced: the difficulty
was to find a motive for Cyrus, reputed a good man, to
make war on his grandfather. Kill him he might by
accident. But the dream required that he should
dethrone his grandfather. Accordingly the dreadful
story is devised; but why should Cyrus adopt the
injuries of a nobleman who, if all were true, had only
saved himself by accident?</p>

<p>Impossible as it would seem to transmute Socrates into
a <i>mythus</i>, considering the broad daylight which then
rested upon Athenian history, and the inextricable way
in which Socrates is entangled in that history (although
we have all seen many a Scriptural personage so transmuted
under far less colourable pretences or advantages),
still it is evident that the medi&aelig;val schoolmen <i>did</i> practically
treat Socrates as something of that sort&mdash;as a
mythical, symbolic, or representative man. Socrates is
the eternal burthen of their quillets, quodlibets, problems,
syllogisms; for them he is the Ulysses of the Odyssey,
that much-suffering man; or, to speak more adequately,
for <i>them</i> he is the John Doe and the Richard Roe of
English law, whose feuds have tormented the earth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
incensed the heavens through a cycle of uncounted centuries,
and must have given a bad character of our planet
on its English side. To such an extent was this pushed,
that many of the scholastic writers became wearied of
enunciating or writing his name, and, anticipating the
occasional fashion of <i>My lud</i> and <i>Your ludship</i> at our
English Bar, or of <i>Hocus Pocus</i> as an abbreviation of pure
weariness for <i>Hoc est Corpus</i>, they called him not <i>Socrates</i>,
but <i>Sortes.</i> Now, whence, let me ask, was this custom
derived? As to Doe and Roe, who or what first set
them by the ears together is now probably past all discovery.
But as to <i>Sortes</i>, that he was a mere contraction
for <i>Socrates</i> is proved in the same way that <i>Mob</i> is shown
to have been a brief way of writing <i>Mobile vulgus</i>, viz.,
that by Bishop Stillingfleet in particular the two forms,
<i>Mob</i> and <i>Mobile vulgus</i> are used interchangeably and indifferently
through several pages consecutively&mdash;just as
<i>Canter</i> and <i>Canterbury gallop</i>, of which the one was at
first the mere shorthand expression of the other, were at
one period interchanged, and for the same reason. The
abbreviated form wore the air of plebeian slang at its
first introduction, but its convenience favoured it: soon
it became reconciled to the ear, then it ceased to be
slang, and finally the original form, ceasing to have any
apparent advantage of propriety or elegance, dropped
into total disuse. <i>Sortes</i>, it is a clear case, inherited
from Socrates his distressing post of target-general for
the arrows of disputatious Christendom. But how came
Socrates by that distinction? I cannot have a doubt
that it was strength of tradition that imputed such a
use of the Socratic name and character to Plato. The
reader must remember that, although Socrates was no
<i>mythus</i>, and least of all could be such, to his own leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
disciple, that was no reason why he should not be treated
as a <i>mythus.</i> In Wales, some nine or ten years ago,
<i>Rebecca</i>, as the mysterious and masqued redresser of
public wrongs, was rapidly passing into a <i>mythical</i> expression
for that universal character of Rhadamanthian
avenger or vindicator. So of Captain Rock, in Ireland.
So of Elias amongst the Jews (<i>when Elias shall come</i>),
as the sublime, mysterious, and in some degree pathetic
expression for a great teacher lurking amongst the
dreadful mists.</p>

<h2><i>VI. DAVID'S NUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE&mdash;THE
POLITICS OF THE SITUATION.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>You read in the Hebrew Scriptures of a man who had
thirty sons, all of whom 'rode on white asses'; the riding
on white asses is a circumstance that expresses their
high rank or distinction&mdash;that all were princes. In Syria,
as in Greece and almost everywhere, white was the regal
symbolic colour.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And any mode of equitation, from the
far inferior wealth of ancient times, implied wealth.
Mules or asses, besides that they were so far superior a
race in Syria no less than in Persia, to furnish a favourite
designation for a warlike hero, could much more conveniently
be used on the wretched roads, as yet found
everywhere, until the Romans began to treat road-making
as a regular business of military pioneering. In this
case, therefore, there were thirty sons of one man, and
all provided with princely establishments. Consequently,
to have thirty sons at all was somewhat surprising, and
possible only in a land of polygamy; but to keep none
back in obscurity (as was done in cases where the funds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>of the family would not allow of giving to each his
separate establishment) argued a condition of unusual
opulence. That it was surprising is very true. But as
therefore involving any argument against its truth, the
writer would justly deny by pleading&mdash;for that very
reason, <i>because</i> it was surprising, did I tell the story. In
a train of 1,500 years naturally there must happen many
wonderful things, both as to events and persons. Were
these crowded together in time or locally, these indeed
we should incredulously reject. But when we understand
the vast remoteness from each other in time or in place,
we freely admit the tendency lies the other way; the
wonder would be if there were <i>not</i> many coincidences
that each for itself separately might be looked upon as
strange. And as the surgeon had set himself to collect
certain cases for the very reason that they were so unaccountably
fatal, with a purpose therefore of including
all that did <i>not</i> terminate fatally, so we should remember
that generally historians (although less so if a Jewish
historian, because he had a far nobler chain of wonders
to record) do not feel themselves open to the objection of
romancing if they report something out of the ordinary
track, since exactly that sort of matter is their object,
and it cannot but be found in a considerable proportion
when their course travels over a vast range of successive
generations. It would be a marvellous thing indeed if
every one of five hundred men whom an author had chosen
to record biographically should have for his baptismal
name&mdash;Francis. But if you found that this was the very
reason for his admitting the man into his series, that,
however strange a reason, it had in fact governed him in
selecting his subjects, you would no longer see anything
to startle your belief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>But let me give an interesting case partly illustrating
this principle. Once I was present on an occasion where,
of two young men, one very young and very clever was
suggesting infidel scruples, and the other, so much older
as to be entering on a professional career with considerable
distinction, was on the very point of drinking-in all
that his companion urged as so much weighty objection
that could not be answered. The younger man (in fact,
a boy) had just used a passage from the Bible, in which
one of the circumstances was&mdash;that the Jewish army
consisted of 120,000 men. 'Now,' said he, 'knowing as
we all do the enormity of such a force as a peace establishment,
even for mighty empires like England, how
perfectly like a fairy-tale or an Arabian Nights' entertainment
does it sound to hear of such monstrous armaments
in a little country like Jud&aelig;a, equal, perhaps, to
the twelve counties of Wales!' This was addressed to
myself, and I could see by the whole expression of the
young physician that his condition was exactly this&mdash;his
studies had been purely professional; he made himself
a king, because (having happened to hurt his leg) he
wore white <i>fasci&aelig;</i> about his thigh. He knew little or
nothing of Scriptural records; he had not read at all
upon this subject; quite as little had he thought, and,
unfortunately, his conversation had lain amongst clever
chemists and naturalists, who had a prejudgment in
the case that all the ability and free power of mind ran
into the channel of scepticism; that only people situated
as most women are should acquiesce in the faith or
politics of their fathers or predecessors, or could believe
much of the Scriptures, except those who were slow to
examine for themselves; but that multitudes pretended
to believe upon some interested motive. This was pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>cisely
the situation of the young physician himself&mdash;he
listened with manifest interest, checked himself when
going to speak; he knew the danger of being reputed
an infidel, and he had no temper for martyrdom, as his
whole gesture and manner, by its tendency, showed what
was passing in his mind. 'Yes, X is right, manifestly
right, and every rational view from our modern standard
of good sense and reflective political economy tends to
the same conclusion. By the reflex light of political
economy we know even at this hour much as to the
condition of ancient lands like Palestine, Athens, etc.,
quite unrevealed to the wisest men amongst them. But
for me, who am entering on a critical walk of social life,
I shall need every aid from advantageous impression in
favour of my religious belief, so I cannot in prudence
speak, for I shall speak too warmly, and I forbear.'</p>

<p>What I replied, and in that instance usefully replied&mdash;for
it sufficed to check one who was gravitating
downwards to infidelity, and likely to settle there for
ever if he once reached that point&mdash;was in substance
this:</p>

<p>Firstly, that the plea, with regard to the numbers as
most extraordinary, was so far from affecting the credibility
of the statement disadvantageously, that on that
ground, agreeably to the logic I have so scantily expounded,
this very feature in the case was what partly
engaged the notice of the Scriptural writer. It <i>was</i> a
great army for so little a nation. And <i>therefore</i>, would
the writer say, <i>therefore</i> in print I record it.</p>

<p>Secondly, that we must not, however, be misled by
the narrow limits, the Welsh limits, to suppose a Welsh
population. For that whilst the twelve counties of
Wales do not <i>now</i> yield above half-a-million of people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Palestine had pretty certainly a number fluctuating
between four and six millions.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that the great consideration of this was
the stage in the expansion of society at which the
Hebrew nation then stood, and the sublime interest&mdash;sublime
enough to them, though far from comprehending
the solemn freight of hopes confided to themselves&mdash;which
they consciously defended. It was an age in
which no pay was given to the soldier. Now, when the
soldier constitutes a separate profession, with the regular
pay he undertakes the regular danger and hardships.
There is no motive for giving the pay and the rations
but precisely that he <i>does</i> so undertake. But when no
pay at all is allowed out of any common fund, it will
never be endured by the justice of the whole society or
by an individual member that he, the individual, as one
insulated stake-holder, having no greater interest embarked
than others, should undertake the danger or the
labour of warfare for the whole. And two inferences
arise upon having armies so immense:</p>

<p>First, that they were a militia, or more properly not
even that, but a Landwehr&mdash;that is, a <i>posse comitatus</i>,
the whole martial strength of the people (one in four),
drawn out and slightly trained to meet a danger, which
in those times was always a passing cloud. Regular and
successive campaigns were unknown; the enemy, whoever
he might be, could as little support a regular army
as the people of Palestine. Consequently, all these
enemies would have to disperse hastily to their reaping
and mowing, just as we may observe the Jews do under
Joshua. It required, therefore, no long absence from
home. It was but a march, but a waiting for opportunity,
watching for a favourable day&mdash;sunshine or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
cloud, the rising or subsiding of a river, the wind in
the enemy's face, or an ambush skilfully posted. All
was then ready; the signal was given, a great battle
ensued, and by sunset of one anxious day all was over
in one way or another. Upon this position of circumstances
there was neither any fair dispensation from
personal service (except where citizens' scruples interfered),
nor any motive for wishing it. On the contrary,
by a very few days' service, a stigma, not for the individual
only, but for his house and kin, would be evaded
for ages of having treacherously forsaken the commonwealth
in agony. And the preference for a fighting
station would be too eager instead of too backward. It
would become often requisite to do what it is evident the
Jews in reality did&mdash;to make successive sifting and winnowing
from the service troops, at every stage throwing
out upon severer principles of examination those who
seemed least able to face a trying crisis, whilst honourable
posts of no great dependency would be assigned to
those rejected, as modes of soothing their offended pride.
This in the case of a great danger; but in the case of an
ordinary danger there is no doubt that many vicarious
arrangements would exist by way of evading so injurious
a movement as that of the whole fighting population.
Either the ordinary watch and ward, in that section
which happened to be locally threatened&mdash;as, for instance,
by invasion on one side from Edom or Moab,
on another side from the Canaanites or Philistines&mdash;would
undertake the case as one which had fallen to
them by allotment of Providence; or that section whose
service happened to be due for the month, without local
regards, would face the exigency. But in any great
national danger, under that stage of society which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Jews had reached between Moses and David&mdash;that stage
when fighting is no separate professional duty, that stage
when such things are announced by there being no military
pay&mdash;not the army which is so large as 120,000
men, but the army which is so small, requires to be
explained.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, the other inference from the phenomenon of
no military pay, and therefore no separate fighting profession,
is this&mdash;that foreign war, war of aggression, war
for booty, war for martial glory, is quite unknown. Now,
all rules of political economy, applied to the maintenance
of armies, must of course contemplate a regular trade of
war pursued with those objects, and not a domestic war
for beating off an attack upon hearths and altars. Such
a war only, be it observed, could be lawfully entertained
by the Jewish people. Mahomet, when he stole all his
great ideas from the Mosaic and Christian revelations,
found it inevitable to add one principle unknown to
either: this was a religious motive for perpetual war of
aggression, and such a principle he discovered in the
imaginary duty of summary proselytism. No instruction
was required. It was sufficient for the convert
that, with or without sincerity, under terror of a sword
at his throat, he spoke the words aloud which disowned
all other faith than in Allah and Mahomet his prophet.
It was sufficient for the soldier that he heard of a nation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>denying or ignoring Mahomet, to justify any atrocity of
invasive warfare. But the Jews had no such commission&mdash;a
proselyte needed more evidences of assent than
simply to bawl out a short formula of words, and he
who refused to become a proselyte was no object of persecution.
Some nations have forced their languages
upon others as badges of servitude. But the Romans
were so far from treating <i>their</i> language in this way,
that they compelled barbarous nations on their frontier
to pay for a license to use the Latin tongue. And with
much more reason did the Jews, instead of wishing to
obtrude their sublime religion upon foreigners, expect
that all who valued it should manifest their value by
coming to Jerusalem, by seeking instruction from the
doctors of the law, and by worshipping in the outer
court of the Temple.</p>

<p>Such was the prodigious state of separation from a
Mahometan principle of fanatical proselytism in which
the Jews were placed from the very first. One small
district only was to be cleared of its ancient idolatrous,
and probably desperately demoralized, tribes. Even this
purification it was not intended should be instant; and
upon the following reason, partly unveiled by God and
partly left to an integration, viz., that in the case of so
sudden a desolation the wild beasts and noxious serpents
would have encroached too much on the human population.
So much is expressed, and probably the sequel
foreseen was, that the Jews would have lapsed into a
wild hunting race, and have outworn that ceremonial
propensity which fitted them for a civil life, which
formed them into a hive in which the great work of
God in Shiloh, His probationary Temple or His glorious
Temple and service at Jerusalem, operated as the mys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>terious
instinct of a queen bee, to compress and organize
the whole society into a cohesion like this of life. Here,
perhaps, lay the reason for not allowing of any sudden
summary extirpation, even for the idolatrous tribes;
whilst, upon a second principle, it was never meant
that this extirpation should be complete. Snares and
temptations were not to be too thickly sown&mdash;in that
case the restless Jew would be too severely tried; but
neither were they to be utterly withdrawn&mdash;in that case
his faith would undergo no probation. Even upon this
small domestic scale, therefore, it appears that aggressive
warfare was limited both for interest and for time.
First, it was not to be too complete; second, even for
this incompleteness it was not to be concentrated within
a short time. It was both to be narrow and to be
gradual. By very necessity, therefore, of its original
appointment this part of the national economy, this
small system of aggressive warfare, could not provide a
reason for a military profession. But all other wars of
aggression, wars operating upon foreign objects, had no
allowance, no motive, no colourable plea; for the attacks
upon Edom, Midian, Moab, were mere acts of
retaliation, and, strictly speaking, not aggressive at all,
but parts of defensive warfare. Consequently there
remained no permanent case of war under Divine allowance
that could ever justify the establishment of a
military caste; for the civil wars of the Jews either
grew out of some one intolerable crime taken up,
adopted, and wickedly defended by a whole tribe (as
in the case of that horrible atrocity committed by a few
Benjamites, and then adopted by the whole tribe), in
which case a bloody exterminating war under God's
sanction succeeded and rapidly drew to a close, or else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
grew out of the ruinous schism between the ten tribes
and the two seated in or about Jerusalem. And as this
schism had no countenance from God, still less could
the wars which followed it. So that what belligerent
state remains that could have been contemplated or
provided for in the original Mosaic theory of their constitution?
Clearly none at all, except the one sole case
of a foreign invasion. But as this, if in any national
strength, struck at the very existence of the people, and
at their holy citadel in Shiloh or in Jerusalem, it called
out the whole military strength to the last man of the
Hebrew people. Consequently in any case, when the
armies could tend at all to great numerical amount, they
must tend to an excessive amount. And, so far from
being a difficult problem to solve in the 120,000 men,
the true difficulty would lie the other way, to account
for its being so much reduced.</p>

<p>It seems to me highly probable that the offence of
David in numbering the people, which ultimately was
the occasion of fixing the site for the Temple of Jerusalem,
pointed to this remarkable military position of
the Jewish people&mdash;a position forbidding all fixed military
institutions, and which yet David was probably contemplating
in that very <i>census.</i> Simply to number the
people could not have been a crime, nor could it be any
desideratum for David; because we are too often told
of the muster rolls for the whole nation, and for each
particular tribe, to feel any room for doubt that the
reports on this point were constantly corrected, brought
under review of the governing elders, councils, judges,
princes, or king, according to the historical circumstances,
so that the need and the criminality of such a
<i>census</i> would vanish at the same moment. But this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was not the <i>census</i> ordered by David. He wanted a
more specific return, probably of the particular wealth
and nature of the employment pursued by each individual
family, so that upon this return he might ground
a permanent military organization for the people; and
such an organization would have thoroughly revolutionized
the character of the population, as well as
drawn them into foreign wars and alliances.</p>

<p>It is painful to think that many amiable and really
candid minds in search of truth are laid hold of by some
plausible argument, as in this case the young physician,
by a topic of political economy, when a local examination
of the argument would altogether change its bearing.
This argument, popularly enforced, seemed to imply
the impossibility of supporting a large force when there
were no public funds but such as ran towards the support
of the Levites and the majestic service of the altar.
But the confusion arises from the double sense of the
word 'army,' as a machine ordinarily disposable for all
foreign objects indifferently, and one which in Jud&aelig;a
exclusively could be applied only to such a service as
must in its own nature be sudden, brief, and always
tending to a decisive catastrophe.</p>

<p>And that this was the true form of the crime, not only
circumstances lead me to suspect, but especially the
remarkable demur of Joab, who in his respectful remonstrance
said in effect that, when the whole strength of
the nation was known in sum&mdash;meaning from the ordinary
state returns&mdash;what need was there to search more inquisitively
into the special details? Where all were
ready to fight cheerfully, why seek for separate <i>minuti&aelig;</i>
as to each particular class? Those general returns had
regard only to the ordinary <i>causa belli</i>&mdash;a hostile inva<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>sion.
And, then, all nations alike, rude or refined, have
gone upon the same general outline of computation&mdash;that,
subtracting the females from the males, this, in a
gross general way, would always bisect the total return
of the population. And, then, to make a second bisection
of the male half would subtract one quarter from
the entire people as too young or too old, or otherwise
as too infirm for warlike labours, leaving precisely one
quarter of the nation&mdash;every fourth head&mdash;as available
for war. This process for David's case would have
yielded perhaps about 1,100,000 fighting men throughout
Palestine. But this unwieldy <i>pospolite</i> was far from
meeting David's secret anxieties. He had remarked the
fickle and insurrectionary state of the people. Even
against himself how easy had it been found to organize
a sudden rebellion, and to conceal it so prosperously that
he and his whole court saved themselves from capture
only by a few hours' start of the enemy, and through the
enemy's want of cavalry. This danger meantime having
vanished, it might be possible that for David personally
no other great conspiracy should disturb his seat upon
the throne. None of David's sons approached to Absalom
in popularity; and yet the subsequent attempt of Adonijah
showed that the revolutionary temper was still awake
in that quarter. But what David feared, in a further-looking
spirit, was the tenure by which his immediate
descendants would maintain their title. The danger was
this: over and above the want of any principle for regulating
the succession, and this want operating in a state
of things far less determined than amongst monogamous
nations&mdash;one son pleading his priority of birth; another,
perhaps, his mother's higher rank, a third pleading his
very juniority, inasmuch as this brought him within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
description of <i>porphyrogeniture</i>, or royal birth, which is
often felt as transcendent as <i>primogeniture</i>&mdash;even the
people, apart from the several pretenders to the throne,
would create separate interests as grounds for insurrection
or for intestine feuds. There seems good reason to
think that already the ten tribes, Israel as opposed to
Judah, looked upon the more favoured and royal tribe
of Judah, with their supplementary section of Benjamin,
as unduly favoured in the national economy. Secretly
there is little doubt that they murmured even against
God for ranking this powerful tribe as the prerogative
tribe. The jealousy had evidently risen to a great height;
it was suppressed by the vigilant and strong government
of Solomon; but at the outset of his son's reign it exploded
at once, and the Scriptural account of the case
shows that it proceeded upon old grievances. The boyish
rashness of Rehoboam might exasperate the leaders, and
precipitate the issue; but very clearly all had been prepared
for a revolt. And I would remark that by the
'young men' of Rehoboam are undoubtedly meant the
soldiers&mdash;the body-guards whom the Jewish kings now
retained as an element of royal pomp. This is the invariable
use of the term in the East. Even in Josephus
the term for the military by profession is generally 'the
young men'; whilst 'the elders' mean the councillors of
state. David saw enough of the popular spirit to be
satisfied that there was no political reliance on the permanence
of the dynasty; and even at home there was
an internal source of weakness. The tribe of Benjamin
were mortified and incensed at the deposition of Saul's
family and the bloody proscription of that family adopted
by David. One only, a grandson of Saul, he had spared
out of love to his friend Jonathan. This was Mephibo-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>sheth;
but he was incapacitated for the throne by lameness.
And how deep the resentment was amongst the
Benjamites is evident from the insulting advantage taken
of his despondency in the day of distress by Shimei.
For Shimei had no motive for the act of coming to the
roadside and cursing the king beyond his attachment to
the house of Saul. Humanly speaking, David's prospect
of propagating his own dynasty was but small. On the
other hand, God had promised him <i>His</i> support. And
hence it was that his crime arose, viz., upon his infidelity,
in seeking to secure the throne by a mere human arrangement
in the first place; secondly, by such an arrangement
as must disorganize the existing theocratic system of the
Jewish people. Upon this crime followed his chastisement
in a sudden pestilence. And it is remarkable in
how significant a manner God manifested the nature of
the trespass, and the particular course through which He
had meant originally, and <i>did</i> still mean, to counteract the
worst issue of David's apprehensions. It happened that
the angel of the pestilence halted at the threshing-floor
of Araunah; and precisely that spot did God by dreams
to David indicate as the site of the glorious Temple.
Thus it seemed as though in so many words God had
declared: 'Now that all is over, your crime and its
punishment, understand that your fears were vain. I
will continue the throne in your house longer than your
anxieties can personally pursue its descent. And with
regard to the terrors from Israel, although this event of
a great schism is inevitable and essential to My councils,
yet I will not allow it to operate for the extinction of your
house. And that very Temple, in that very place where
My angel was commissioned to pause, shall be one great
means and one great pledge to you of My decree in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
favour of your posterity. For this house, as a common
sanctuary to all Jewish blood, shall create a perpetual
interest in behalf of Judah amongst the other tribes,
even when making war upon Jerusalem.' Witness if it
were but that one case where 200,000 captives of Judah
were restored without ransom, were clothed completely,
were fed, by the very men who had just massacred their
fighting relatives.</p>

<h2><i>VII. THE JEWS AS A SEPARATE PEOPLE.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The argument for the separation and distinct current of
the Jews, flowing as they pretend of the river Rhone
through the Lake of Geneva&mdash;never mixing its waters
with those which surround it&mdash;has been by some infidel
writers defeated and evaded by one word; and here, as
everywhere else, an unwise teacher will seek to hide the
answer. Yet how infinitely better to state it fully, and
then show that the evasion has no form at all; but, on
the contrary, powerfully argues the inconsistency and
incapacity of those who urge it. For instance, I remember
Boulanger, a French infidel, whose work was
duly translated by a Scotchman, answers it thus: What
is there miraculous in all this? he demands. Listen to
me, and I will show you in two minutes that it rests upon
mere show and pure delusion. How is it, why is it, that
the Jews have remained a separate people? Simply from
their usages, in the first place; but, secondly, still more
from the fact that these usages, which with other peoples
exist also in some representative shape, with <i>them</i>
modify themselves, shift, alter, adapt themselves to the
climate or to the humour or accidents of life amongst
those amidst whom chance has thrown them; whereas
amongst the Jews every custom, the most trivial, is also
part of their legislation; and their legislation is also their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
religion. (Boulanger, by the way, is far from expressing
that objection so clearly as I have here done; but this is
his drift and purpose, so far as he knew how to express it.)
Take any other people&mdash;Isaurians, Athenians, Romans,
Corinthians&mdash;doubtless all these and many others have
transmitted their blood down to our ages, and are now
living amongst us by representation. But why do we not
perceive this? Why do the Athenians seem to have
perished utterly? Simply for this reason: they were a
plastic, yielding, unobstinate race. An Athenian lived
in a port of Italy, married an Italian woman; thence
threw out lines of descent to Milan, thence to Paris; and
because his Attic usages were all local, epichorial, and
tied to a particular mythology which has given way, or to
a superstition which is defunct, or to a patriotic remembrance
which has vanished with the land and the
sympathy that supported it; hence, and upon other
similar arguments, the Athenian has long since melted
into the mass with which he was intermixed; he was a
unit attached to a vast overpowering number from another
source, and into that number he has long since been
absorbed; he was a drop in a vast ocean, and long ago
he has been confounded with the waters that did not
differ, except numerically, from his own. But the Jews
are an obstinate, bigoted people; and they have maintained
their separation, not by any overruling or coercing
miracle, but in a way perfectly obvious and palpable to
themselves&mdash;obvious by its operation, obvious in its
remedy. They would not resign their customs. Upon
these ordinances, positive and negative, commanding and
forbidding many peculiar rites, consecrating and desecrating
many common esculent articles, these Jews have
laid the stress and emphasis of religion. They would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
not resign them; they did not expect others to adopt
them&mdash;not in any case; <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> not from a degraded
people. And hence, not by any mysterious operation of
Providential control, arose their separation, their resolute
refusal to blend with other races.</p>

<p>This is the infidel's attempt to rebut, to defeat, utterly
to confound, the argumentative force of this most astonishing
amongst all historical pictures that the planet
presents.</p>

<p>The following is the answer:</p>

<p>It is forgotten that along with the Jews there is another
people concerned as illustrations of the same prophetic
fatality&mdash;of that same inevitable eye, that same perspective
of vision, which belonged to those whose eyes God
had opened. The Arabs, as children of a common
ancestor, ought not to be forgotten in this sentence
upon their brother nation. They through Ishmael, the
Jews through Isaac, and more immediately through
Israel the son of Isaac, were two diverging branches of
one original stem; and to both was pronounced a corresponding
doom&mdash;a sentence which argued in both a principle
of duration and self-propagation, that is memorable
in any race. The children of Ishmael are the Arabs of
the desert. Their destiny as a roving robber nation, and
liable to all men's hands, as they indifferently levied
spoil on all, was early pronounced. And here, again, we
see at once how it will be evaded: it is the desert, it is
the climate, it is the solemnity of that unchanging basis,
which will secure the unchanging life of its children.
But it is remarkable enough that Gibbon and other
infidels, kicking violently against this standing miracle
(because, if not so in itself, yet, according to Bishop
Butler's just explanation concerning miraculous <i>per de</i>-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><i>rivationem</i>
as recording a miraculous power of vision),
have by oscillation clung to the fixture of basis, and rejected
it; for now Gibbon denies that the Arabs have
held this constant tenor of life; they have changed it, he
asserts, in large and notorious cases. Well, then, if they
have, then at once falls to the ground this alleged overruling
coercion <i>a priori</i> of the climate and the desert.
Climate and desert do not necessarily coerce them, if in
large and notorious cases they have failed to do so. So
feels Gibbon; and, by an instinct of timidity, back he flies
to the previous evasion&mdash;to the natural controlling power
of climate and soil, admitting the Scriptural fact, but
seeking for it an unscriptural ground, as before he had
flown in over-precipitate anxiety to the denial of the
Scriptural fact, but in that denial involving a withdrawal
of the unscriptural ground.</p>

<p>The sceptics in that instance show their secret sense
of a preference from the distracted eagerness with which
they fly backwards and forwardwise between two reciprocally
hostile evasions.</p>

<p>The answer I reserve, and meantime I remark:</p>

<p>Secondly, that, supposing this answer to have any
force, still it meets only one moiety of the Scriptural
fatality; viz., the dispersion of the Jews&mdash;the fact that,
let them be gathered in what numbers they might, let
them even be concentrated by millions, therefore in the
literal sense <i>not</i> dispersed, yet in the political sense universally
understood, they would be dispersed, because never,
in no instance, rising to be a people, <i>sui juris</i>, a nation,
a distinct community, known to the public law of Europe
as having the rights of peace and war, but always a mere
accident and vagrant excess amongst nations, not having
the bare rights of citizenship; so far from being a nation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
not being an acknowledged member of any nation. This
exquisite dispersion&mdash;not ethnographic only, but political&mdash;is
that half of the Scriptural malediction which the
Boulanger answer attempts to meet; but the other half&mdash;that
they should be 'a byword, an astonishment,' etc.&mdash;is
entirely blinked. Had the work even prospered, it would
still have to recommence. The Armenians are dispersed
through all Eastern lands, so are the Arabs; even the
descendants of Ali are found severed from their natal
soil; but they are not therefore dispersed: they have
endured no general indignities.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it does not meet the fact of the Jewish
<i>existence</i> in any shape, whether as a distinct or an amalgamated
people. There is no doubt that many races of
men, as of brute animals, have been utterly extinguished.
In cases such as those of the Emim, or
Rethinim, a race distinguished by peculiar size, so as to be
monstrous in comparison with other men, this extinction
could more readily be realized; or in the case of a nation
marked, as Herodotus records, by a slighter texture of
scale, the extinction might be ascertained by the physiologist;
but no doubt it has often occurred, precisely as a
family is extinguished, or as certain trees (for example,
the true golden pippin) are observed to die off, not by
local influences only, but by a decay attacking the very
principle of their existence. Of many ancient races it is
probable enough that no blood directly traced from them
could at this day be searched by the eye of God.
Families arise amongst the royal lineage of Europe that
suddenly, like a lamp fitfully glowing up just the moment
before it expires, throw off, as by some final effort, a
numerous generation of princes and princesses; then
suddenly all contract as rapidly into a single child, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
perishing, the family is absolutely extinct. And so must
many nations have perished, and so must the Jews have
been pre-eminently exposed to perish, from the peculiar,
fierce, and almost immortal, persecutions which they
have undergone, and the horrid frenzies of excited mobs
in cruel cities of which they have stood the brunt.</p>

<h2><i>VIII. 'WHAT IS TRUTH?' THE JESTING
PILATE SAID&mdash;A FALSE GLOSS.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>It is true that Pilate could not be expected fully to comprehend
an idea which was yet new to man; Christ's
words were beyond his depth. But, still, his natural
light would guide him thus far&mdash;that, although he had
never heard of any truth which rose to that distinction,
still, if any one class of truth should in future come to
eclipse all other classes of truth immeasurably, as regarded
its practical results, as regarded some dark dependency
of human interests, in that case it would
certainly merit the distinctive name of 'The Truth.'
The case in which such a distinction would become
reasonable and available was one utterly unrealized to
his experience, not even within the light of his conjectures
as to its special conditions; but, still, as a general
possibility it was conceivable to his understanding;
though not comprehensible, yet apprehensible. And
in going on to the next great question, to the inevitable
question, 'What <i>is</i> the truth?' Pilate had no thought of
jesting. Jesting was the last thing of which his impassioned
mood in that great hour was capable. Roman
magistrates of supreme rank were little disposed to jesting
on the judgment-seat amongst a refractory and dan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>gerous
people; and of Pilate in particular, every word,
every effort, every act, demonstrate that he was agitated
with new instincts and misgivings of some shadowy
revelation opening upon man, that his heart was convulsed
with desponding anxiety in the first place to save
the man who appeared the depositary of this revelation,
but who, if, after all, only a sublime lunatic, was, at the
very least, innocent of all offence. It must have struck
all close observers of early Christianity how large a proportion
of the new converts lay amongst Roman officers,
or (to speak more adequately) amongst Romans of high
rank, both men and women. And for that there was
high reason. In the advance of civilization, and in the
corresponding decay of idolatrous religions, there was
fast arising a new growth of cravings amongst men.
Mythological and desperately immoral religions, that
spoke only to the blind sense of power, had been giving
way through the three previous centuries to a fearful
extent. They had receded from the higher natures of
both Greece and Rome as the sea has locally receded
from many shores of the earth. Such natures were left
'miserably bare'; the sense of dependency by any tie
upon the invisible world, or at least upon the supernatural
world, had decayed, and unless this painful void
were filled up by some supplementary bond in the same
direction, a condition of practical atheism must take
place, such as could not but starve and impoverish in
human nature those yearnings after the infinite which
are the pledges of all internal grandeur. But this dependency
could not be replaced by one of the same
vicious nature. Into any new dependency a new element
must be introduced. The sense of insufficiency would
be renewed in triple strength if merely the old relations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of weakness to power, of art to greater art, of intellect
to higher intellect, of less to more within the same exact
limits as to kind of excellence, should be rehearsed
under new names or improved theogonies. Hitherto, no
relation of man to divine or demoniac powers had included
the least particle or fraction or hint of any moral
element; nor was such an element possible in that dependency,
for profound reasons.</p>

<h2><i>IX. WHAT SCALIGER SAYS ABOUT THE
EPISTLE TO JUDE.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Before any canon was settled, many works had become
current in Christian circles whose origin was dubious.
The traditions about them varied locally. Some, it is
alleged, that would really have been entitled to a
canonical place, had been lost by accident; to some,
which still survived, this place had been refused upon
grounds that might not have satisfied <i>us</i> of this day, if
we had the books and the grounds of rejection before us;
and, finally, others, it is urged, have obtained this sacred
distinction with no right to it. In particular, the Second
Epistle of St. Peter, the Second of St. Jude, the Epistle
of St. James, and the three of St. John, are denounced
as supposititious in the 'Scaligerana.' But the writer
before us is wrong in laying any stress on the opinions
there expressed. They bear the marks of conversational
haste and of Scaligeran audacity. What is the objection
made, for instance, to 'in quibus sunt mira, qu&aelig; non
<i>videntur</i> esse Apostolica'? <i>That</i> is itself more strange as
a criticism than anything in the epistles <i>can</i> be for its
doctrine. The only thing tending to a reason for the
summary treatment is that the Eastern Church does not
acknowledge them for canonical. But opinions quoted
from <i>ana</i> are seldom of any authority; indeed, I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
myself too frequently seen the unfaithfulness of such
reports. The reporter, as he cannot decently be taking
notes at the time of speaking, endeavours afterwards to
recall the most interesting passages by memory. He
forgets the context; what introduced&mdash;what followed to
explain or modify the opinions. He supplies a conjectural
context of his own, and the result is a romance.
But if the reporter were even accurate, so much allowance
must be made for the license of conversation&mdash;its
ardour, its hurry, and its frequent playfulness&mdash;that when
all these deductions are made, really not a fraction
remains that one can honestly carry to account. Besides,
the elder Scaliger was drunk pretty often, and Joe
seems rather 'fresh' at times.</p>

<p>Upon consideration, it may be as well to repeat what
it is that Scaliger is reported to have said:</p>

<p>'The Epistle of Jude is not <i>his</i>, as neither is that
of James, nor the <i>second</i> of Peter, in all which are
strange things that seem (seem&mdash;mark that!) far enough
from being Apostolical. The three Epistles of John are
not from John the Apostle. The second of Peter and
Jude belong to a later age. The Eastern Church does
not own them, neither are they of evangelical authority.
They are unlearned, and offer no marks of Gospel
majesty. As regards their internal value, believe them
I may say that I do, but it is because they are in no ways
hostile to <i>us.</i>'</p>

<p>Now, observe, the grounds of objection are purely
&aelig;sthetical, except in the single argument from the
authority of the Eastern Church. What does he mean
by 'unlearned,' or wanting 'majesty,' or containing
'strange things'? Were ever such vague puerilities
collected into one short paragraph? This is pure imper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>tinence,
and <i>Phil.</i> deserves to be privately reprimanded
for quoting such windy chaff without noting and protesting
it as colloquial. But what I wish the reader to
mark&mdash;the <ins class="mycorr" title="tho hepimhythion">&#952;&#959; &#7953;&#960;&#953;&#956;&#8017;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#957;</ins>&mdash;is, that suppose the two Scaligers
amongst the Christian Fathers engaged in fixing the
canon: greater learning you cannot have; neither was
there, to a dead certainty, one tenth part as much
amongst the canon-settlers. Yet all this marvellous
learning fumes away in boyish impertinence. It confounds
itself. And every Christian says, Oh, take away
this superfluous weight of erudition, that, being so rare
a thing, cannot be wanted in the broad highways of
religion. What we <i>do</i> want is humility, docility,
reverence for God, and love for man. These are sown
broadcast amongst human hearts. Now, these apply
themselves to the <i>sense</i> of Scripture, not to its grammatical
niceties. But if so, even that case shows indirectly
how little could depend upon the mere verbal
attire of the Bible, when the chief masters of verbal
science were so ready to go astray&mdash;riding on the billows
so imperfectly moored. In the <i>ideas</i> of Scripture lies its
eternal anchorage, not in its perishable words, which are
shifting for ever like quicksands, as the Bible passes by
translation successively into every spoken language of
the earth.</p>

<p>What then?&mdash;'What then?' retorts the angry reader
after all this, 'why then, perhaps, there may be a screw
loose in the Bible.' True, there may, and what is more,
some very great scholars take upon them to assert that
there is. Yet, still, what then? The two possible errors
open to the Fathers of our canon, to the men upon whom
rested the weighty task of saying to all mankind what
should be Bible, and what should be <i>not</i> Bible, of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and limiting that mighty world, are&mdash;that they may have
done that which they ought <i>not</i> to have done, and,
secondly, left undone that which they ought to have
done. They may have admitted writers whom they ought
to have excluded; and they may have excluded writers
whom they ought to have admitted. This is the extent
of their possible offences, and they are supposed by some
critics to have committed both. But suppose that they
<i>have</i>, still I say&mdash;what then? What is the nature of the
wrong done to us by the worst mistake ascribed to them?
Let us consider. It is supposed by some scholars that
we have in the New Testament as it now stands a work
written by Apollos, viz., the Epistle to the Romans.
Yet, if so, the error amounts only to a misnomer. On
the other hand, there are Epistles on which has been
charged the same error in relation to the name of the
author, and the more important error of thoughts unbecoming
to a Christian in authority: for instance, the
Epistle of St. James. This charge was chiefly urged by
a very intemperate man, and in a very intemperate style.
I notice it as being a case which <i>Phil.</i> has noticed. But
<i>Phil.</i> merits a gentle rap on his knuckles for the inconsideration
with which he has cited a charge made and
reported with so much levity. He quotes it from the
'Scaligerana.' Now, what right upon such a subject has
any man to quote such an authority? The reasons
against listening with much attention to the 'Scaligerana'
are these:</p>

<p>First, the Scaligers, both father and son, were the
two most impudent men that ever walked the planet. I
should be loath to say so ill-natured a thing as that their
impudence was equal to their learning, because that forces
every man to say, 'Ah, then, what impudent fellows they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
must have been!' It is kinder and juster to say that
their learning was at least equal to their impudence, for
<i>that</i> will force every man to exclaim, 'Ah, if so, what
prodigies of learning they must have been!' Yes, they
were&mdash;absolute monsters of learning, learned monsters.
But as much learning often makes men mad, still more
frequently it makes them furious for assault and battery;
to use the American phrase, they grow 'wolfy about the
shoulders,' from a periodical itchiness for fighting.
Other men being shy of attacking the Scaligers, it was no
fault of theirs, you know, but a necessity, to attack other
men&mdash;unless you expected them to have no fighting at
all. It was always a reason with <i>them</i> for trying a fall
with a writer, if they doubted much whether they had
any excuse for hanging a quarrel on.</p>

<p>Secondly, all <i>ana</i> whatever are bad authorities. Supposing
the thing really said, we are to remember the huge
privilege of conversation, how immeasurable is that!
You yourself, reader, I presume, when talking, will say
more in an hour than you will stand to in a month. I'm
sure <i>I</i> do. When the reins are put into my hands I stick
at nothing&mdash;headlong I drive like a lunatic, until the very
room in which we are talking, with all that it inherits,
seems to spin round with absolute vertigo at the extravagances
I utter.</p>

<p>Thirdly, but again, was the thing really said? For, as
another censure upon the whole library of <i>ana</i>, I can
assert&mdash;that, if the license of conversation is enormous,
to that people who inhale that gas of colloquial fermentation
seldom mean much above one part in sixty of what
they say, on the other hand the license of reporters is
far greater. To forget the circumstances under which a
thing was said is to alter the thing, to have lost the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>text,
the particular remark in which your own originated,
the mitigations of a harsh sentiment from playfulness of
manner; in short, to drop the <i>setting</i> of the thoughts is
oftentimes to falsify the tendency and value of those
thoughts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p><span class="smcap">Note by the Editor</span>.&mdash;The <i>Phil.</i> here referred to is the <i>Philoleutheros
Anglicanus</i> of the essay on 'Protestantism,' as shortened by De
Quincey, and with whom De Quincey, in that essay, deals very effectively
and wittily on occasion.</p></div>

<h2><i>X. MURDER AS A FINE ART.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h3>(SOME NOTES FOR A NEW PAPER.)</h3>


<p>A new paper on Murder as a Fine Art might open thus:
that on the model of those Gentlemen Radicals who had
voted a monument to Palmer, etc., it was proposed to
erect statues to such murderers as should by their next-of-kin,
or other person interested in their glory, make out
a claim either of superior atrocity, or, in equal atrocity,
of superior neatness, continuity of execution, perfect preparation
or felicitous originality, smoothness or <i>curiosa
felicitas</i> (elaborate felicity). The men who murdered the
cat, as we read in the Newgate Calendar, were good, but
Williams better who murdered the baby. And perhaps
(but the hellish felicity of the last act makes us demur)
Fielding was superior. For you never hear of a fire
swallowing up a fire, or a rain stopping a deluge (for this
would be a reign of Kilkenny cats); but what fire, deluge,
or Kilkenny cats could not do, Fielding proposed, viz., to
murder the murderers, to become himself the Nemesis.
Fielding was the murderer of murderers in a double sense&mdash;rhetorical
and literal. But that was, after all, a small
matter compared with the fine art of the man calling
himself Outis, on which for a moment we must dwell.
Outis&mdash;so at all events he was called, but doubtless he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
indulged in many aliases&mdash;at Nottingham joined vehemently
and sincerely, as it seemed, in pursuit of a wretch
taxed with having murdered, twelve years previously, a
wife and two children at Halifax, which wretch (when
all the depositions were before the magistrate) turned out
to be the aforesaid Mr. Outis. That suggests a wide
field of speculation and reference.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Note the power of murderers as fine-art professors to
make a new start, to turn the corner, to retreat upon the
road they have come, as though it were new to them, and
to make diversions that disarm suspicion. This they owe
to fortunate obscurity, which attests anew the wonderful
compensations of life; for celebrity and power combine
to produce drawbacks.</p>

<p>A foreigner who lands in Calcutta at an hour which
nobody can name, and endeavours to effect a sneaking
entrance at the postern-gate<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of the governor-general's
palace, <i>may</i> be a decent man; but this we know, that
he has cut the towing-rope which bound his own boat
to the great ark of his country. It may be that, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>leaving Paris or Naples, he was simply cutting the connection
with creditors who showed signs of <i>attachment</i>
not good for his health. But it may also be that he
ran away by the blaze of a burning inn, which he had
fired in order to hide three throats which he had cut,
and nine purses which he had stolen. There is no
guarantee for such a man's character. Have we, then,
no such <i>vauriens</i> at home? No, not in the classes
standing favourably for promotion. The privilege of
safe criminality, not liable to exposure, is limited to
classes crowded together like leaves in Vallombrosa;
for <i>them</i> to run away into some mighty city, Manchester
or Glasgow, is to commence life anew. They turn over
a new leaf with a vengeance. Many are the carpenters,
bricklayers, bakers' apprentices, etc., who are now living
decently in Bristol, Newcastle, Hull, Liverpool, after
marrying sixteen wives, and leaving families to the care
of twelve separate parishes. That scamp is at this
moment circulating and gyrating in society, like a
respectable <i>te-totum</i>, though we know not his exact name,
who, if he were pleased to reveal himself in seventeen
parts of this kingdom, where (to use the police language)
he has been 'wanted' for some years, would be hanged
seventeen times running, besides putting seventeen
Government rewards into the pockets of seventeen policemen.
Oh, reader, you little know the unutterable
romances perpetrated for ever in our most populous
empire, under cloud of night and distance and utter
poverty, Mark <i>that</i>&mdash;of utter poverty. Wealth is power;
but it is a jest in comparison of poverty. Splendour is
power; but it is a joke to obscurity. To be poor, to
be obscure, to be a baker's apprentice or a tailor's
journeyman, throws a power about a man, clothes him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
with attributes of ubiquity, <i>really</i> with those privileges
of concealment which in the ring of Gyges were but
fabulous. Is it a king, is it a sultan, that such a man
rivals? Oh, friend, he rivals a spiritual power.</p>

<p>Two men are on record, perhaps many more <i>might</i>
have been on that record, who wrote so many books,
and perpetrated so many pamphlets, that at fifty they
had forgotten much of their own literary villainies, and
at sixty they commenced with murderous ferocity a
series of answers to arguments which it was proved upon
them afterwards that they themselves had emitted at
thirty&mdash;thus coming round with volleys of small shot
on their own heads, as the Whispering Gallery at St.
Paul's begins to retaliate any secrets you have committed
to its keeping in echoing thunders after a time,
or as Sir John Mandeville under Arctic skies heard in
May all those curses thawing, and exploding like minute-guns,
which had been frozen up in November. Even
like those self-replying authors, even like those self-reverberators
in St. Paul's, even like those Arctic practitioners
in cursing, who drew bills and <i>post obits</i> in malediction,
which were to be honoured after the death of
winter, many men are living at this moment in merry
England who have figured in so many characters, illustrated
so many villages, run away from so many towns,
and performed the central part in so many careers, that
were the character, the village, the town, the career,
brought back with all its circumstances to their memories,
positively they would fail to recognise their own presence
or incarnation in their own acts and bodies.</p>

<p>We have all read the story told by Addison of a sultan,
who was persuaded by a dervish to dip his head into a
basin of enchanted water, and thereupon found himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
upon some other globe, a son in a poor man's family,
married after certain years the woman of his heart,
had a family of seven children whom he painfully
brought up, went afterwards through many persecutions,
walked pensively by the seashore meditating some
escape from his miseries, bathed in the sea as a relief
from the noon-day heat, and on lifting up his head from
the waves found himself lifting up his head from the
basin into which that cursed dervish had persuaded him
to dip. And when he would have cudgelled the holy
man for that long life of misery which had, through <i>his</i>
means, been inflicted upon himself, behold! the holy
man proved by affidavit that, in this world, at any rate
(where only he could be punishable), the life had lasted
but thirty-three seconds. Even so do the dark careers
of many amongst our obscure and migratory villains
from years shrink up to momentary specks, or, by their
very multitude, altogether evanesce. Burke and Hare,
it is well known, had lost all count of their several
murders; they no more remembered, or could attempt
to remember, their separate victims, than a respectable
old banker of seventy-three can remember all the bills
with their indorsements made payable for half-a-century
at his bank; or than Foote's turnpike-keeper, who had
kept all the toll-bar tickets to Kensington for forty-eight
years, pretended to recollect the features of all the men
who had delivered them at his gate. For a time,
perhaps, Burke (who was a man of fine sensibility) had
a representative vision of spasms, and struggles, and
convulsions, terminating in a ten-pound note indorsed
by Dr. &mdash;&mdash;. Hare, on the other hand, was a man of
principle, a man that you could depend upon&mdash;order a
corpse for Friday, and on Friday you had it&mdash;but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
had no feeling whatever. Yet see the unity of result for
him and Burke. For both alike all troublesome recollections
gathered into one blue haze of heavenly abstractions:
orders executed with fidelity, cheques on the
bankers to be crossed and passed and cashed, are no
more remembered. That is the acme of perfection in
our art.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>One great class of criminals I am aware of in past
times as having specially tormented myself&mdash;the class
who have left secrets, riddles, behind them. What
business has any man to bequeath a conundrum to all
posterity, unless he leaves in some separate channel the
solution? This must have been done in malice, and for
the purpose of annoying us, lest we should have too
much proper enjoyment of life when he should have
gone. For nobody knows whether the scoundrel could
have solved it himself&mdash;too like in that respect to some
charades which, in my boyish days (but then I had the
excuse of youth, which they had not), I not unfrequently
propounded to young ladies. Take this as a
specimen: My first raises a little hope; my second very
little indeed; and my whole is a vast roar of despair.
No young lady could ever solve it; neither could I. We
all had to give it up. A charade that only needs an
answer, which, perhaps, some distant generation may
supply, is but a half and half, tentative approach to this.
Very much of this nature was the genius or Daimon
(don't say <i>De</i>mon) of Socrates. How many thousands
of learned writers and printers have gone to sleep over
too profound attempts to solve <i>that</i>, which Socrates
ought to have been able to solve at sight. I am myself
of opinion that it was a dram-bottle, which someone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
raised a ghost to explain. Then the Entelecheia of
Aristotle; did you ever read about that, excellent reader?
Most people fancy it to have meant some unutterable
crotchet in metaphysics, some horrible idea (lest the
police should be after it) without a name; that is, until
the Stagyrite repaired the injustice of his conduct by
giving it a pretty long one. My opinion now, as you
are anxious to know it, is, that it was a lady, a sweetheart
of Aristotle's; for what was to hinder Aristotle
having a sweetheart? I dare say Thomas Aquinas, dry
and arid as he was, raised his unprincipled eyes to some
Neapolitan beauty, began a sonnet to some lady's eyebrow,
though he might forget to finish it. And my belief
is that this lady, ambitious as Semele, wished to be
introduced as an eternal jewel into the great vault of
her lover's immortal Philosophy, which was to travel
much farther and agitate far longer than his royal pupil's
conquests. Upon that Aristotle, keeping her hand, said:
'My love, I'll think of it.' And then it occurred to him,
that in the very heavens many lovely ladies, Andromeda,
Cassiopeia, Ariadne, etc., had been placed as constellations
in that map which many chronologists suppose
to have been prepared for the use of the ship <i>Argo</i>, a
whole generation before the Trojan war. Berenice,
though he could not be aware of <i>that</i>, had interest even
to procure a place in that map for her ringlets; and of
course for herself she might have. Considering which,
Aristotle said: 'Hang me! if I don't put her among the
ten Categories!' On after thoughts he put her higher,
for an Entelecheia is as much above a Category as our
Padishah Victoria is above a Turkish sultan. 'But
now, Stag,' said the lady (privileged as a sweetheart
she called him <i>Stag</i>, though everybody else was obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to call him Stagyrite), 'how will they know it's meant
for me, Stag?' Upon which I am sorry to say the
philosopher fell to cursing and swearing, bestowing blessings
on his own optics and on posterity's, meaning yours
and mine, saying: 'Let them find it out.' Well, now,
you see I <i>have</i> found it out. But that is more than I
hope for my crypto-criminals, and therefore I take this
my only way of giving them celebration and malediction
in one breath.</p>

arose another sort of robbers in Jerusalem, who were named Sicarii,
who slew men in the day-time and in the middle of the city, more
especially at the festivals. There they mixed with the multitude, and

stabbed those that were their enemies; and when any fell down dead,

<h2><i>XI. ANECDOTES&mdash;JUVENAL.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>All anecdotes, as I have often remarked in print, are
lies. It is painful to use harsh words, and, knowing by
my own feelings how much the reader is shocked by this
rude word <i>lies</i>, I should really be much gratified if it
were possible to supplant it by some gentler or more
courteous word, such as <i>falsehoods</i>, or even <i>fibs</i>, which
dilutes the atrocity of untruth into something of an
amiable weakness, wrong, but still venial, and natural
(and so far, therefore, reasonable). Anything for peace:
but really in this instance I cannot indulge the reader.
The instincts of morality will not allow of it, and still less
the passion which made Juvenal a poet,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> viz., the passion
of enormous and bloody indignation. From the beginning
of this century, with wrath continually growing, I have
laid it down as a rule, and if the last year of it, viz.,
<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1900, should overhear <i>my</i> voice amongst the
babblings that will then be troubling the atmosphere&mdash;in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>that case it will hear me still reaffirming, with an indignation
still gathering strength, and therefore approaching
ever nearer and nearer to a Juvenalian power of versification,
so that perhaps I shall then speak in rhymed
couplets&mdash;that all anecdotes pretending to be <i>smart</i>,
but to a dead certainty if they pretend to be <i>epigrammatic</i>,
are and must be lies. There is, in fact, no
security for the truth of an anecdote, no guarantee
whatever, except its intense stupidity. If a man is
searched at a police-office, on the ground that he was
caught trying the window-shutters of silversmiths; then,
if it should happen that in his pockets is found absolutely
nothing at all except one solitary paving-stone, in that
case Charity, which believeth all things (in fact, is
credulous to an anile degree), will be disposed to lock up
the paving-stone, and restore it to the man on his liberation
as if it were really his own, though philosophy
mutters indignantly, being all but certain that the fellow
stole it. And really I have been too candid a great deal
in admitting that a man may appropriate an anecdote,
and establish his claim to it by pleading its awful stupidity.
That might be the case, and I believe it <i>was</i>, when anecdotes
were many and writers were few. But things are
changed now. Fifty years ago, if a man were seen
running away with the pace of a lunatic, and you should
sing out, 'Stop that fellow; he is running off with the
shin-bone of my great-grandmother!' all the people in
the street would have cried out in reply, 'Oh, nonsense!
What should he want with your great-grandmother's
shin-bone?' and that would have seemed reasonable.
But now, to see how things are altered, any man of
sense would reply, 'What should he want with my great-grandmother's
shin-bone? Why, he'll grind it, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
he'll mix it with guano.' This is what he and the like of
him have actually done by shiploads of people far more
entitled to consideration than any one of my four great-grandmothers
(for I had <i>four</i>, with eight shin-bones
amongst them). It is well known that the field of
Waterloo was made to render up all its bones, British or
French, to certain bone-mills in agricultural districts.
Borodino and Leipzig, the two bloodiest of modern battlefields,
are supposed between them&mdash;what by the harvest
of battle, what by the harvest of neighbouring hospitals&mdash;to
be seized or possessed of four hundred thousand shin-bones,
and other interesting specimens to match. Negotiations
have been proceeding at various times between
the leading bone-mills in England and the Jews in
Dresden or in Moscow. Hitherto these negotiations
have broken down, because the Jews stood out for
37 per shent., calculated upon the costs of exhumation.
But of late they show a disposition to do business at
33 per shent.: the contract will therefore move forwards
again; it will go ahead; and the dust of the
faithful armies, together with the dust of their enemies,
will very soon be found, not in the stopper of a bunghole
(as Prince Hamlet conceived too prematurely), but in an
unprecedented crop of Swedish turnips.</p>

<p>Bones change their value, it seems thus clearly; and
anecdotes change their value; and in that proportion
honesty, as regards one or the other, changes the value of
its chances. But what has all this to do with 'Old
Nick'? Stop: let me consider. That title was placed at
the head of this article, and I admit that it was placed
there by myself. Else, whilst I was wandering from my
text, and vainly endeavouring to recollect what it was
that I had meant by this text, a random thought came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
over me (immoral, but natural), that I would charge the
heading of <i>Old Nick</i> upon the compositor, asserting that
he had placed it there in obstinate defiance of all the
orders to the contrary, and supplications to the contrary,
that I had addressed to him for a month; by which
means I should throw upon <i>him</i> the responsibility of
accounting for so portentous an ensign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p><span class="smcap">Editor's Note.</span>&mdash;It is evident that De Quincey meditated a much
longer essay on anecdotes as false, in which Niccolo Machiavelli would
have come in for notice&mdash;hence the playful references in the close.</p></div>

<h2><i>XII. ANNA LOUISA.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<h3>SPECIMEN TRANSLATION FROM VOSS IN HEXAMETERS, WITH<br />
LETTER TO PROFESSOR W. ('CHRISTOPHER NORTH').</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. North</span>,</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>, I say, for I hear that the six Universities
of England and Scotland have sent you a doctor's degree,
or, if they have not, all the world knows they ought to
have done; and the more shame for them if they keep no
'Remembrancer' to put them in mind of what they must
allow to be amongst their most sacred duties. But that's
all one. I once read in my childhood a pretty book,
called 'Wilson's Account of the Pelew Islands,' at which
islands, you know, H.M.S. <i>Antelope</i> was wrecked&mdash;just
about the time, I fancy, when you, Doctor, and myself
were in long petticoats and making some noise in the
world; the book was not written by Captain Wilson, but
by Keates, the sentimentalist. At the very end, however,
is an epitaph, and that <i>was</i> written by the captain and
ship's company:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Stop, reader, stop, let nature claim a tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prince of mine, Lee Boo, lies buried here.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This epitaph used often to make me cry, and in commemoration
of that effect, which (like that of all cathartics
that I know of, no matter how drastic at first) has long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
been growing weaker and weaker, I propose (upon your
allowing me an opportunity) to superscribe you in any
churchyard you will appoint:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Stop, reader, stop, let genius claim a tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A doct'r of mine, Lee Kit, lies buried here.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'<i>Doct'r of</i>' you are to read into a dissyllable, and pretty
much like Boney's old friend on the road from Moscow,
General Doct'roff, who 'doctor'd them off,' as the
Laureate observes, and prescribed for the whole French
army <i>gratis.</i> But now to business.</p>

<p>For <i>your</i> information, Doctor, it cannot be necessary,
but on account of very many readers it will be so, to say
that Voss's 'Luise' has long taken its place in the
literature of Germany as a classical work&mdash;in fact, as a
gem or cabinet <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i>; nay, almost as their unique
specimen in any national sense of the lighter and less
pretending muse; less pretending, I mean, as to the
pomp or gravity of the subject, but on that very account
more pretending as respects the minuter graces of its
execution. In the comparative estimate of Germans,
the 'Luise' holds a station corresponding to that of our
'Rape of the Lock,' or of Gresset's 'Vert-vert'&mdash;corresponding,
that is, in its <i>degree</i> of relative value. As to
its <i>kind</i> of value, some notion may be formed of it even
in that respect also from the 'Rape of the Lock,' but
with this difference, that the scenes and situations and
descriptions are there derived from the daily life and
habits of a fashionable belle and the fine gentlemen who
surround her, whereas in the 'Luise' they are derived
exclusively from the homelier and more patriarchal
economy of a rural clergyman's household; and in this
respect the 'Luise' comes nearest by much, in com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>parison
of any other work that I know of, to our own
'Vicar of Wakefield.' Like that delightful portrait of
rural life in a particular aspect, or idyll as it might be
called, the 'Luise' aims at throwing open for our amusement
the interior of a village parsonage (<i>Scotice</i>, 'manse');
like that in its earlier half (for the latter half of the
'Vicar' is a sad collapse from the truth and nature of the
original conception into the marvellous of a commonplace
novel), the 'Luise' exhibits the several members
of a rustic clergyman's family according to their differences
of sex, age, and standing, in their natural, undisguised
features, all unconsciously marked by characteristic
foibles, all engaged in the exercise of their daily habits,
neither finer nor coarser than circumstances naturally
allow, and all indulging in such natural hopes or fictions
of romance as grow out of their situation in life. The
'Luise,' in short, and the 'Vicar of Wakefield' are both
alike a succession of circumstantial delineations selected
from mere rustic life, but rustic life in its most pure and
intellectual form; for as to the noble countess in the
'Luise,' or the squire and his uncle, Sir William, in the
'Vicar of Wakefield,' they do not interfere sufficiently to
disturb the essential level of the movement as regards
the incidents, or to colour the manners and the scenery.
Agreeing, however, in this general purpose, the two works
differ in two considerable features; one, that the 'Vicar
of Wakefield' describes the rural clergyman of England,
'Luise' the rural clergyman of North Germany; the
other, that the English idyll is written in prose, the
German in verse&mdash;both of which differences, and the
separate peculiarities growing out of them, will, it may
perhaps be thought, require a few words of critical discussion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>There has always existed a question as to the true
principles of translation when applied, not to the mere
literature of <i>knowledge</i> (because <i>there</i> it is impossible that
two opinions can arise, by how much closer the version
by so much the better), but to the literature of <i>power</i>,
and to such works&mdash;above all, to poems&mdash;as might fairly
be considered <i>works of art</i> in the highest sense. To what
extent the principle of <i>compensation</i> might reasonably be
carried, the license, that is, of departing from the strict
literal forms of the original writer, whether as to expressions,
images, or even as to the secondary thoughts,
for the sake of reproducing them in some shape less
repellent to a modern ear, and therefore virtually sustaining
the harmony of the composition by preventing the
attention from settling in a disproportionate degree upon
what might have a startling effect to a taste trained
under modern discipline&mdash;this question has always been
pending as a question open to revision before the modern
courts of criticism; as surely to you, Dr. North, one of
the chief 'swells' on that bench, I need not say. But,
for the sake of accurate thinking, it is worth while
observing that formerly this question was moved almost
exclusively with a view to the Latin and Greek classics;
and that circumstance gave a great and a very just bias
to the whole dispute. For the difference with regard to
any capital author of ancient days, as compared with
modern authors, is this, that here we have a twofold
interest&mdash;an interest with work, and a separate interest
in the writer. Take the 'Prometheus Desmotes' of
&AElig;schylus, and suppose that a translator should offer us
an English 'Prometheus,' which he acknowledged to be
very free, but at the same time contended that his variations
from the Greek were so many downright improve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ments,
so that, if he had not given us the genuine
'Prometheus,' he had given us something better. In such
a case we should all reply, but we do not want something
better. Our object is not the best possible drama
that could be produced on the fable of 'Prometheus';
what we want is the very 'Prometheus' that was written
by &AElig;schylus, the very drama that was represented at
Athens. The Athenian audience itself, and what pleased
its taste, is already one subject of interest. &AElig;schylus on
his own account is another. These are collateral and
alien subjects of interest quite independent of our interest
in the drama, and for the sake of these we wish to
see the real original 'Prometheus'&mdash;not according to any
man's notion of improvement, but such as came from a
sublime Grecian poet, such as satisfied a Grecian audience,
more than two thousand years ago. We wish, in fact,
for the real &AElig;schylus, 'unhousel'd, unaneal'd,' with all
his imperfections on his head.</p>

<p>Such was the way, and the just way, of arguing the
point when the application was limited to a great
authentic classic of the Antique; nor was the case at all
different where Ariosto or any other illustrious Italian
classic was concerned. But a new sort of casuistry in
this question has arisen in our own times, and by accident
chiefly in connection with German literature; but it
may well be, Dr. North, that you will be more diverted
by a careful scrutiny of my metres after Voss in illustration,
than by any further dissertation on my part on a
subject that you know so well.</p>

<span class="i0">In the month of leafy June, beneath celestial azure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of skies all cloudless, sate the aged Rector of Esthwaite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dining amidst his household; but not the meridian ardour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sunbeams fierce he felt; him the shady veranda<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vine-clad trellis defends: beyond a pendulous awning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of boughs self-wreath'd from limes (whose mighty limbs overarching<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For young and old alike; noontide awfully breathless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settled in deepest silence on the woods and valley of Esthwaite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not the less there would rise, after stillest interval often,<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low whispering gales that stole, like sobbing murmur of infant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming in arms maternal, into the heart o' the youngest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gales that at most could raise a single ringlet of auburn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it pencill'd the noble brow of the youthful Anna Louisa&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole child that survived to thee, oh, aged pastor of Esthwaite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in his morning gown, the reverend priest at a table<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sculptur'd stone was seated; and his seat was a massy but easy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settle of oak, which in youth his ancient servitor, Isaac,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And through many a long, long night of many a dark December.<span class='linenum'>21</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good man's heart was glad, and his eyes were suffus'd with a rapture<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The one sole prop of his house, the beautiful Anna Louisa.<br /></span>

<h2><i>XIII. SOME THOUGHTS ON BIOGRAPHY.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>We have heard from a man who witnessed the failure of
Miss Baillie's 'De Montford,' notwithstanding the scenic
advantages of a vast London theatre, fine dresses, fine
music at intervals, and, above all, the superb acting
of John Kemble, supported on that occasion by his incomparable
sister, that this unexpected disappointment
began with the gallery, who could not comprehend or enter
into a hatred so fiendish growing out of causes so slight
as any by possibility supposable in the trivial Rezenvelt.
To feel teased by such a man, to dislike him, occasionally
to present him with your compliments in the shape of a
duodecimo kick&mdash;well and good, nothing but right. And
the plot manifestly tended to a comic issue. But murder!&mdash;a
Macbeth murder!&mdash;not the injury so much as the
man himself was incommensurate, was too slight by a
thousand degrees for so appalling a catastrophe. It
reacts upon De Montford, making <i>him</i> ignoble that could
be moved so profoundly by an agency so contemptible.</p>

<p>Something of the same disproportion there is, though
in a different way, between any quarrel that may have
divided us from a man in his life-time and the savage
revenge of pursuing the quarrel after his death through
a malicious biography. Yet, if you hated him through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
no quarrel, but simply (as we all hate many men that
died a thousand years ago) for something vicious, or
which you think vicious, in his modes of thinking, why
must you, of all men, be the one to undertake an edition
of his works, 'with a life of the author'? Leave that
to some neutral writer, who neither loves nor hates.
And whilst crowds of men need better biographical
records whom it is easy to love and not difficult to
honour, do not you degrade your own heart or disgust
your readers by selecting for your exemplification not a
model to be imitated, but a wild beast to be baited or a
criminal to be tortured? We privately hate Mr. Thomas
Hobbes, of Malmsbury; we know much evil of him, and
we could expose many of his tricks effectually. We also
hate Dean Swift, and upon what we think substantial
arguments. Some of our own contemporaries we hate
particularly; Cobbett, for instance, and other bad fellows
in fustian and corduroys. But for that very reason we
will not write their lives. Or, if we should do so, only
because they might happen to stand as individuals in a
series, and after warning the reader of our own bias.
For it is too odious a spectacle to imprison a fellow-creature
in a book, like a stag in a cart, and turn him
out to be hunted through all his doubles for a day's
amusement. It too much resembles that case of undoubted
occurrence both in France and Germany, where
'respectable' individuals, simply as amateurs, and not at
all with any view to the salary or fees of operating, have
come forward as candidates for the post of public executioner.
What is every man's duty is no man's duty
by preference. And unless where a writer is thrust upon
such a duty by an official necessity (as, if he contracts
for a 'Biographia Britannica,' in that case he is bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
by his contract to go through with the whole series&mdash;rogues
and all), it is too painful to see a human being
courting and wooing the task of doing execution upon his
brother in his grave. Nay, even in the case where this
executioner's task arises spontaneously out of some duty
previously undertaken without a thought of its severer
functions, we are still shocked by any exterminating
vengeance too rancorously pursued. Every reader must
have been disgusted by the unrelenting persecution with
which Gifford, a deformed man, with the spiteful nature
sometimes too developed in the deformed, had undertaken
'for our fathers in the Row' an edition of
Massinger. Probably he had not thought at the time of
the criminals who would come before him for judgment.
But afterwards it did not embitter the job that these
perquisites of office accrued, <i>lucro ponatur</i>, that such
offenders as Coxeter, Mr. Monck Mason, and others were
to be 'justified' by course of law. Could he not have
stated their errors, and displaced their rubbish, without
further personalities? However, he does <i>not</i>, but makes
the air resound with his knout, until the reader wishes
Coxeter in his throat, and Monck Mason, like 'the
cursed old fellow' in Sinbad, mounted with patent spurs
upon his back.</p>

<p>We shall be interrupted, however, and <i>that</i> we
certainly foresee, by the objection&mdash;that we are fighting
with shadows, that neither the <i>&eacute;loge</i> in one extreme, nor
the libel in the other extreme, finds a place in <i>our</i>
literature. Does it not? Yes, reader, each of these
biographical forms exists in favour among us, and of one
it is very doubtful indeed whether it ought not to exist.
The <i>&eacute;loge</i> is found abundantly diffused through our
monumental epitaphs in the first place, and <i>there</i> every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
man will countersign Wordsworth's judgment (see 'The
Excursion' and also Wordsworth's prose Essay on
Epitaphs), that it is a blessing for human nature to find
one place in this world sacred to charitable thoughts,
one place at least offering a sanctuary from evil speaking.
So far there is no doubt. But the main literary form, in
which the English <i>&eacute;loge</i> presents itself, is the Funeral
Sermon. And in this also, not less than in the churchyard
epitaph, kind feeling ought to preside; and for the
same reasons, the sanctity of the place where it is
delivered or originally published, and the solemnity of
the occasion which has prompted it; since, if you
cannot find matter in the departed person's character
fertile in praise even whilst standing by the new-made
grave, what folly has tempted you into writing an
epitaph or a funeral sermon? The good ought certainly
to predominate in both, and in the epitaph nothing <i>but</i>
the good, because were it only for a reason suggested by
Wordsworth, viz., the elaborate and everlasting character
of a record chiselled out painfully in each separate letter,
it would be scandalous to confer so durable an existence
in stone or marble upon trivial human infirmities, such
as do not enter into the last solemn reckoning with the
world beyond the grave; whilst, on the other hand, all
graver offences are hushed into 'dread repose,' and,
where they happen to be too atrocious or too memorable,
are at once a sufficient argument for never having undertaken
any such memorial. These considerations privilege
the epitaph as sacred to charity, and tabooed against the
revelations of candour. The epitaph cannot open its
scanty records to any breathing or insinuation of
infirmity. But the Funeral Sermon, though sharing in
the same general temper of indulgence towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
errors of the deceased person, might advantageously be
laid open to a far more liberal discussion of those personal
or intellectual weaknesses which may have thwarted the
influence of character otherwise eminently Christian.
The <i>Oraison Fun&egrave;bre</i> of the French proposes to itself by
its original model, which must be sought in the <i>Epideictic</i>
or panegyrical oratory of the Greeks, a purpose purely
and exclusively eulogistic: the problem supposed is to
abstract from everything <i>not</i> meritorious, to expand and
develop the total splendour of the individual out of that
one centre, that main beneficial relation to his own age,
from which this splendour radiated. The incidents of
the life, the successions of the biographical detail, are but
slightly traced, no farther, in fact, than is requisite to
the intelligibility of the praises. Whereas, in the
English Funeral Sermon, there is no principle of absolute
exclusion operating against the minutest circumstantiations
of fact which can tend to any useful purpose of
illustrating the character. And what is too much for the
scale of a sermon literally preached before a congregation,
or modelled to counterfeit such a mode of
address, may easily find its place in the explanatory
notes. This is no romance, or ideal sketch of what
might be. It is, and it has been. There are persons
of memorable interest in past times, of whom all that we
know is embodied in a funeral sermon. For instance,
Jeremy Taylor in that way, or by his Epistles Dedicatory,
has brought out the characteristic features in
some of his own patrons, whom else we should have
known only as <i>nominis umbras.</i> But a more impressive
illustration is found in the case of John Henderson, that
man of whom expectations so great were formed, and of
whom Dr. Johnson and Burke, after meeting and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>versing
with him, pronounced (in the Scriptural words of
the Ethiopian queen applied to the Jewish king, Solomon)
'that the half had not been told them.' For this
man's memory almost the sole original record exists in
Aguttar's funeral sermon; for though other records
exist, and one from the pen of a personal friend, Mr.
Joseph Cottle, of Bristol, yet the main substance of the
biography is derived from the <i>fundus</i> of this one sermon.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
And it is of some importance to cases of fugitive or
unobtrusive merit that this more quiet and sequestered
current of biography should be kept open. For the local
motives to an honorary biographical notice, in the shape
of a Funeral Sermon, will often exist, when neither the
materials are sufficient, nor a writer happens to be
disposable, for a labour so serious as a regular biography.</p>

<p>Here then, on the one side, are our English <i>&eacute;loges.</i> And
we may add that amongst the Methodists, the Baptists,
and other religious sectaries, but especially among the
missionaries of all nations and churches, this class of
<i>&eacute;loges</i> is continually increasing. Not unfrequently men
of fervent natures and of sublime aspirations are thus
rescued from oblivion, whilst the great power of such
bodies as the Methodists, their growing wealth, and
consequent responsibility to public opinion, are pledges
that they will soon command all the advantages of
colleges and academic refinement; so that if, in the
manner of these funeral <i>&eacute;loges</i>, there has sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>been missed that elegance which should have corresponded
to the weight of the matter, henceforwards we
may look to see this disadvantage giving way before
institutions more thoroughly matured. But if these are
our <i>&eacute;loges</i>, on the other hand, where are our libels?</p>

<p>This is likely to be a topic of offence, for many readers
will start at hearing the upright Samuel Johnson and
the good-humoured, garrulous Plutarch denounced as
traffickers in libel. But a truth is a truth. And the
temper is so essentially different in which men lend
themselves to the propagation of defamatory anecdotes,
the impulses are so various to an offence which is not
always consciously perceived by those who are parties to
it, that we cannot be too cautious of suffering our hatred
of libel to involve every casual libeller, or of suffering our
general respect for the person of the libeller to exonerate
him from the charge of libelling. Many libels are
written in this little world of ours unconsciously, and
under many motives. Perhaps we said that before, but
no matter. Sometimes a gloomy fellow, with a murderous
cast of countenance, sits down doggedly to the
task of blackening one whom he hates worse 'than toad
or asp.' For instance, Procopius performs that 'labour
of hate' for the Emperor Justinian, pouring oil into his
wounds, but, then (as Coleridge expresses it in a 'neat'
sarcasm), oil of vitriol. Nature must have meant the man
for a Spanish Inquisitor, sent into the world before
St. Dominic had provided a trade for him, or any vent
for his malice&mdash;so rancorous in his malignity, so horrid
and unrelenting the torture to which he subjects his
sovereign and the beautiful Theodora. In this case,
from the withering scowl which accompanies the libels,
we may be assured that they <i>are</i> such in the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
aggravated form&mdash;not malicious only, but false. It is
commonly said, indeed, in our courts, that truth it is
which aggravates the libel. And so it is as regards the
feelings or the interests of the man libelled. For is it
not insufferable that, if a poor man under common
human infirmity shall have committed some crime and
have paid its penalty, but afterwards reforming or out-growing
his own follies, seeks to gain an honest livelihood
for his children in a place which the knowledge of
his past transgression has not reached, then all at once
he is to be ruined by some creature purely malignant
who discovers and publishes the secret tale? In such a
case most undoubtedly it is the truth of the libel which
constitutes its sting, since, if it were not true or could be
made questionable, it would do the poor man no mischief.
But, on the other hand, it is the falsehood of the libel
which forms its aggravation as regards the publisher.
And certain we are, had we no other voucher than the
instinct of our hatred to Procopius, that his disloyal tales
about his great lord and lady are odiously overcharged,
if not uniformly false. Gibbon, however, chooses to
gratify his taste for the luxury of scandal by believing at
once in the perfect malice of the slanderer, and the
perfect truth of his slanders.</p>

<p>Here then, in this Procopius, is an instance of the
gloomy libeller, whose very gloom makes affidavit of his
foul spirit from the first. There is also another form,
less odious, of the hostile libeller: it occurs frequently in
cases where the writer is not chargeable with secret
malice, but is in a monstrous passion. A shower-bath
might be of service in that case, whereas in the Procopius
case nothing but a copious or a <i>Pro</i>copius
application of the knout can answer. We, for instance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
have (or had, for perhaps it has been stolen) a biography
of that same Parker, afterwards Bishop of Oxford, with
whom Andrew Marvell 'and others who called Milton
friend' had such rough-and-tumble feuds about 1666, and
at whose expense it was that Marvell made the whole
nation merry in his 'Rehearsal Transprosed.' This Parker
had a 'knack' at making himself odious; he had a
<i>curiosa felicitas</i> in attracting hatreds, and wherever he
lodged for a fortnight he trailed after him a vast
parabolic or hyperbolic tail of enmity and curses, all
smoke and fire and tarnish, which bore the same ratio to
his small body of merit that a comet's tail, measuring
billions of miles, does to the little cometary mass. The
rage against him was embittered by politics, and indeed
sometimes by knavish tricks; the first not being always
'confounded,' nor the last 'frustrated.' So that Parker,
on the whole, was a man whom it might be held a duty
to hate, and therefore, of course, to knout as often as
you could persuade him to expose a fair extent of surface
for the action of the lash. Many men purchased a knout
for his sake, and took their chance for getting a 'shy' at
him, as Parker might happen to favour their intentions.
But one furious gentleman, who is resolved to 'take his
full change' out of Parker, and therefore to lose no time,
commences operations in the very first words of his
biography: 'Parker,' says he, 'the author of &mdash;&mdash;,
was the <i>spawn</i> of Samuel Parker.' His rage will not
wait for an opportunity; he throws off a torrent of fiery
sparks in advance, and gives full notice to Parker that he
will run his train right into him, if he can come up with
his rear. This man is not malicious, but truculent; like
the elder Scaliger, of whom it was observed that, having
been an officer of cavalry up to his fortieth year (when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
he took to learning Greek), he always fancied himself on
horseback, charging, and cutting throats in the way of
professional duty, as often as he found himself summoned
to pursue and 'cut up' some literary delinquent. Fire
and fury, 'bubble and squeak,' is the prevailing character
of his critical composition. 'Come, and let me give thee
to the fowls of the air,' is the cry with which the martial
critic salutes the affrighted author. Yet, meantime, it is
impossible that he can entertain any personal malice, for
he does not know the features of the individual enemy
whom he is pursuing. But thus far he agrees with the
Procopian order of biographers&mdash;that both are governed,
in whatever evil they may utter, by a spirit of animosity:
one by a belligerent spirit which would humble its enemy
as an enemy in a fair pitched battle, the other by a subtle
spirit of malice, which would exterminate its enemy not
in that character merely, but as an individual by poison
or by strangling.</p>

<p>Libels, however, may be accredited and published
where there is no particle of enmity or of sudden
irritation. Such were the libels of Plutarch and
Dr. Johnson. They are libels prompted by no hostile
feelings at all, but adopted by mere blind spirit of
credulity. In this world of ours, so far as we are
acquainted with its doings, there are precisely four
series&mdash;four aggregate bodies&mdash;of <i>Lives</i>, and no more,
which you can call celebrated; which <i>have</i> had, and are
likely to have, an extensive influence&mdash;each after its own
kind. Which be they? To arrange them in point of
time, first stand Plutarch's lives of eminent Greeks and
Romans; next, the long succession of the French
Memoirs, beginning with Philippe de Commines, in the
time of Louis XI. or our Edward IV., and ending, let us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
say, with the slight record of himself (but not without
interest) of Louis XVIII.; thirdly, the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>
of the Bollandists; fourthly, Dr. Johnson's 'Lives of the
Poets.' The third is a biographical record of the Romish
saints, following the order of the martyrology as it is
digested through the Roman calendar of the year; and,
as our own 'Biographia Britannica' has only moved forwards
in seventy years to the letter 'H,' or thereabouts
(which may be owing to the dissenting blight of Dr.
Kippis), <i>pari passu</i>, the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> will be found
not much farther advanced than the month of May&mdash;a
pleasant month certainly, but (as the <i>Spectator</i> often
insinuates) perilous to saintship. Laying this work out
of consideration, as being chiefly employed in eulogy
such as <i>could</i> not be extravagant when applied to the
glorious army of martyrs (although here also, we doubt
not, are many libels against men concerning whom it
matters little whether they were libelled or not), all the
rest of the great biographical works are absolutely
saturated with libels. Plutarch may be thought to
balance his extravagant slanders by his impossible
eulogies. He sees nothing wonderful in actions that
were far beyond the level of any motives existing under
pagan moralities; and, on the other hand, he traduces
great men like C&aelig;sar, whose natures were beyond his
scale of measurement, by tracing their policy to petty
purposes entirely Plutarchian. But he was a Greekling
in a degenerate age of Grecians. As to the French
Memoirs, which are often so exceedingly amusing, they
purchase their liveliness by one eternal sacrifice of plain
truth. Their repartees, felicitous <i>propos</i>, and pointed
anecdotes are but one rolling fire of falsehoods. And,
generally, it may be laid down as a rule, that all collec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>tors
of happy retorts and striking anecdotes are careless
of truth. Louis XIV. <i>does</i> seem to have had a natural
gift of making brilliant compliments and happy impromptus;
and yet the very best of his reputed <i>mots</i>
were spurious. Some may be traced to Cicero, Hierocles,
Diogenes; and some to his modern predecessors. That
witty remark ascribed to him about the disposition of
Fortune, as being a lady, to withdraw her favours from
old men like himself and the Mar&eacute;chal Boufflers, was
really uttered nearly two centuries before by the
Emperor Charles V., who probably stole it from some
Spanish collection of jests. And so of fifty in every
hundred beside. And the French are not only apt
beyond other nations to abuse the license of stealing
from our predecessor <i>quod licuit semperque licebit</i>, but
also, in a degree peculiar to themselves, they have a false
de-naturalized taste in the humorous, and as to the
limits of the extravagant. We have formerly illustrated
this point, and especially we noticed it as a case impossible
to any nation <i>but</i> the French to have tolerated
the pretended 'absences' of La Fontaine&mdash;as, for instance,
his affecting to converse with his own son as an entire
stranger, and asking the lady who had presented him
what might be the name of that amiable young man.
The <i>incredulus odi</i> faces one in every page of a French
memoir; veracity is an unknown virtue, and, wherever
that is the taste, look for libels by wholesale. Too often
even the unnatural and the monstrous is courted, rather
than miss the object of arresting and startling. Now,
Dr. Johnson's calumnies or romances were not of that
order. He had a healthy spirit of reverence for truth;
but he was credulous to excess, and he was plagued by an
infirmity not uncommon amongst literary men who have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
no families of young people growing up around their
hearth&mdash;the hankering after gossip. He was curious
about the domestic habits of his celebrated countrymen;
inquisitive in a morbid degree about their pecuniary
affairs: 'What have you got in that pocket which bulges
out so prominently?' 'What did your father do with
that hundred guineas which he received on Monday from
Jacob Jonson?' And, as his 'swallow' was enormous&mdash;as
the Doctor would believe more fables in an hour than
an able-bodied liar would invent in a week&mdash;naturally
there was no limit to the slanders with which his 'Lives
of the Poets' are overrun.</p>

<p>Of the four great biographical works which we have
mentioned, we hold Dr. Johnson's to be by far the best
in point of composition. Even Plutarch, though pardonably
overrated in consequence of the great subjects which
he treats (which again are 'great' by benefit of distance
and the vast abstracting process executed by time upon
the petty and the familiar), is loose and rambling in the
principles of his <i>nexus</i>; and there lies the great effort for
a biographer, there is the strain, and that is the task&mdash;viz.,
to weld the disconnected facts into one substance,
and by interfusing natural reflections to create for the
motions of his narrative a higher impulse than one merely
chronologic. In this respect, the best of Dr. Johnson's
'Lives' are undoubtedly the very best which exist. They
are the most highly finished amongst all masterpieces of
the biographic art, and, as respects the Doctor personally,
they are, beyond comparison, his best work. It is a great
thing in any one art or function, even though it were not
a great one, to have excelled all the literature of all
languages. And if the reader fancies that there lurks
anywhere a collection of lives, or even one life (though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
it were the 'Agricola' of Tacitus), which as a work of
refined art and execution can be thought equal to the
best of Dr. Johnson's, we should be grateful to him if he
would assign it in a letter to Mr. Blackwood:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'And though the night be raw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll see it too, the first we ever saw.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We say nothing of the Calmuck Tartars; they hold (see
Bergmann's 'Streifereien') that their 'Dschangariade' is
the finest of all epic poems, past or coming; and, therefore,
the Calmuck Lives of the Poets will naturally be
inimitable. But confining our view to the unhappy
literatures of Europe, ancient or modern, this is what
we think of Dr. Johnson's efforts as a biographer.
Consequently, we cannot be taxed with any insensibility
to his merit. And as to the critical part of his Lives, if no
thoughtful reader can be expected to abide by his haughty
decisions, yet, on the other hand, every man reads his
opinions with pleasure, from the intellectual activity and
the separate justice of the thoughts which they display.
But as to his libellous propensity, that rests upon independent
principles; for all his ability and all his logic
could not elevate his mind above the region of gossip.</p>

<p>Take his 'Life of Savage.' This was the original nest-egg,
upon which, as a basis, and perhaps as the occasional
suggestion of such an enterprise, all the rest&mdash;allow us a
pompous word&mdash;supervened. It was admirably written,
because written <i>con amore</i>, and also because written <i>con
odio</i>; and under either impulse is it possible to imagine
grosser delusions? Johnson persuaded himself that
Savage was a fine gentleman (a <i>r&ocirc;le</i> not difficult to support
in that age, when ceremony and a gorgeous <i>costume</i>
were amongst the auxiliary distinctions of a gentleman),
and also that he was a man of genius. The first claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
was necessarily taken upon trust by the Doctor's readers;
the other might have been examined; but after a few
painful efforts to read 'The Wanderer' and other insipid
trifles, succeeding generations have resolved to
take <i>that</i> upon trust also; for in very truth Savage's
writings are of that order which 'do not let themselves
be read.' Why, then, had publishers bought them?
Publishers in those days were mere tradesmen, without
access to liberal society. Even Richardson, though a
man of great genius, in his publisher's character was an
obsequious, nay, servile, admirer of the fine gentleman
who wore a sword, embroidered clothes, and Mechlin
ruffles about his wrists; above all things, he glorified and
adored a Lovelace, with a fine person, who sang gaily to
show his carelessness of low people, never came abroad
except in a sedan-chair, and liberally distributed his
curses to the right and the left in all respectable men's
shops. This temper, with her usual sagacity, Lady M.
Wortley Montagu could detect in Richardson, and for this
she despised him. But this it was, and some little vision
of possible patronage from Lord Tyrconnel, which had
obtained any prices at all for Savage from such knowing
publishers as were then arising; but generally Savage
had relied upon subscriptions, which were still common,
and, in his case, as a man supposed unfortunate, were
given purely as charity. With what astonishment does
a literary foreigner of any judgment find a Savage placed
amongst the classics of England! and from the scale of
his life reasonably he must infer that he is ranked
amongst the leaders, whilst the extent in which his
works are multiplied would throw him back upon the
truth&mdash;that he is utterly unknown to his countrymen.
These, however, were the delusions of good nature. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
what are we to think of Dr. Johnson's abetting that
monstrous libel against Lady Macclesfield? She, unhappily,
as a woman banished without hope from all
good society by her early misconduct as a wife (but, let it
not be forgotten, a neglected wife), had nobody to speak
a word on her behalf: all evil was believed of one who
had violated her marriage vows. But had the affair
occurred in our days, the public journals would have
righted her. They would have shown the folly of believing
a vain, conceited man like Savage and his nurse,
with no vouchers whatever, upon a point where they had
the deepest interest at stake; whilst on the opposite side,
supposing their story true, spoke for them the strongest
of all natural instincts&mdash;the pleading of the maternal
heart, combated by no self-interest whatever. Surely if
Lady Macclesfield had not been supported by indignation
against an imposture, merely for her own ease and comfort,
she would have pensioned Savage, or have procured
him some place under Government&mdash;not difficult in those
days for a person with her connections (however sunk as
respected <i>female</i> society) to have obtained for an only
son. In the sternness of her resistance to all attempts
upon her purse we read her sense of the fraud. And, on
the other hand, was the conduct of Savage that of a son?
He had no legal claims upon her, consequently no pretence
for molesting her in her dwelling-house. And
would a real son&mdash;a great lubberly fellow, well able to
work as a porter or a footman&mdash;however wounded at her
obstinate rejection, have been likely, in pursuit of no
legal rights, to have alarmed her by threatening letters
and intrusions, for no purpose but one <i>confessedly</i> of
pecuniary extortion? From the very mode of pursuing
his claim it is plain that Savage felt it to be a false one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
It seems, also, to be forgotten by most readers, that at
this day real sons&mdash;not denied to be such&mdash;are continually
banished, nay, ejected forcibly by policemen, from the
paternal roof in requital of just such profligate conduct
as Savage displayed; so that, grant his improbable story,
still he was a disorderly reprobate, who in these days
would have been consigned to the treadmill. But the
whole was a hoax.</p>

<p>Savage, however, is but a single case, in relation to
which Dr. Johnson stood in a special position, that
diseased his judgment. But look at Pope's life, at Swift's,
at Young's&mdash;at all the lives of men contemporary with
himself: they are overrun with defamatory stories, or
traits of that order which would most have stung them,
had they returned to life. But it was an accident most
beneficial to Dr. Johnson that nearly all these men left
no near relatives behind to call him to account. The
public were amused, as they always are by exhibitions of
infirmity or folly in one whom otherwise they were compelled
to admire; that was a sort of revenge for them to
set off against a painful perpetuity of homage. Thus far
the libels served only as jests, and, fortunately for Dr.
Johnson, there arose no after-reckoning. One period, in
fact, of thirty years had intervened between the last of
these men and the publication of the Lives; it was
amongst the latest works of Dr. Johnson: thus, and because
most of them left no descendants, he escaped.
Had the ordinary proportion of these men been married,
the result would have been different; and whatever
might have been thought of any individual case amongst
the complaints, most undoubtedly, from the great number
to which the Doctor had exposed himself, amongst which
many were not of a nature to be evaded by any vouchers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
whatsoever, a fatal effect would have settled on the
Doctor's moral reputation. He would have been passed
down to posterity as a dealer in wholesale scandal, who
cared nothing for the wounded feelings of relatives. It is
a trifle after that to add that he would frequently have
been cudgelled.</p>

<p>This public judgment upon Dr. Johnson and these
cudgellings would have been too severe a chastisement
for the offences, which, after all, argued no heavier
delinquency than a levity in examining his chance
authorities, and a constitutional credulity. Dr. Johnson's
easiness of faith for the supernatural, the grossness of his
superstition in relation to such miserable impostures as
the Cock Lane ghost, and its scratchings on the wall,
flowed from the same source; and his conversation
furnishes many proofs that he had no principle of resistance
in his mind, no reasonable scepticism, when any
disparaging anecdote was told about his nearest friends.
Who but he would have believed the monstrous tale:
that Garrick, so used to addressing large audiences <i>extempore</i>,
so quick and lively in his apprehensions, had absolutely
been dismissed from a court of justice as an idiot&mdash;as
a man incapable of giving the court information
even upon a question of his own profession? As to his
credulity with respect to the somewhat harmless forgeries
of Psalmanazer, and with respect to the villainous imposture
of Lander, we imagine that other causes co-operated
to those errors beyond mere facility of assenting. In the
latter case we fear that jealousy of Milton as a scholar, a
feeling from which he never cleansed himself, had been the
chief cause of his so readily delivering himself a dupe to
allegations <i>not</i> specious, backed by forgeries that were
anything but ingenious. Dr. Johnson had a narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
escape on that occasion. Had Dr. Douglas fastened
upon him as the collusive abettor of Lander, as the man
whose sanction had ever won even a momentary credit
for the obscure libeller, and as the one beyond all others
of the age whose critical occupation ought most to have
secured him against such a delusion, the character of
Johnson would have suffered seriously. Luckily, Dr.
Douglas spared him; and Johnson, seeing the infamy of
the hoax, and the precipice near which he stood, hastened
to separate himself from Lander, and to offer such reparation
as he could, by dictating that unhappy letter of
recantation. Lander must have consented to this step
from hopes of patronage; and perhaps the obscure place
of slave-driver in the West Indies, in which he died (after
recanting his recantation), might be the unsatisfactory
bait of his needy ambition. But assuredly Lander could
have made out a better case for himself than that which,
under his name, the Doctor addressed to the Bishop; it
was a dark spot in Dr. Johnson's life. A Scotsman, said
he, must be a strange one who would not tell a falsehood
in a case where Scotland was concerned; and we fear
that any fable of defamation must have been gross indeed
which Dr. Johnson would not have countenanced against
Milton. His 'Life of Milton,' as it now stands, contains
some of the grossest calumnies against that mighty poet
which have ever been hazarded; and some of the deepest
misrepresentations are coloured, to the unsuspecting
reader, by an affectation of merriment. But in his 'heart
of hearts' Dr. Johnson detested Milton. Gray, even
though, as being little of a meddler with politics, he
furnished no handle to the Doctor for wrath so unrelenting,
was a subject of deep jealousy from his reputed
scholarship. Never did the spite of the Doctor more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
emblazon itself than in his review of Gray's lyrical compositions;
the very affectation of prefacing his review by
calling the two chief odes 'the wonderful wonder of
wonders' betrays a female spite; and never did the arrogance
of Dr. Johnson's nature flame out so conspicuously
as in some of the phrases used on this occasion. Perhaps
it is an instance of self-inflation absolutely unique where
he says, 'My kindness for a man of letters'; this, it
seems, caused him to feel pain at seeing Gray descending
to what he, the Doctor (as a one-sided opinion of his own),
held to be a fantastic foppery. The question we point at
is not this supposed foppery&mdash;was it such or not? Milton's
having cherished that 'foppery' was a sufficient argument
for detesting it. What we fix the reader's eye upon is,
the unparalleled arrogance of applying to Gray this extreme
language of condescending patronage. He really
had 'a kindness' for the little man, and was not ashamed,
as some people would be, to own it; so that it shocked
him more than else it would have done, to see the man
disgracing himself in this way.</p>

<p>However, it is probable that all the misstatements of
Dr. Johnson, the invidious impressions, and the ludicrous
or injurious anecdotes fastened <i>ad libitum</i> upon men
previously open to particular attacks, never will be exposed;
and for this, amongst other reasons, that sometimes
the facts of the case are irrecoverable, though
falsehood may be apparent; and still more because few
men will be disposed to degrade themselves by assuming
a secondary and ministerial office in hanging upon the
errors of any man. Pope was a great favourite with
Dr. Johnson, both as an unreflecting Tory, who travelled
the whole road to Jacobitism&mdash;thus far resembling the
Doctor himself; secondly, as one who complimented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
himself whilst yet a young man, and even whilst wearing
a masque&mdash;complimented him under circumstances which
make compliments doubly useful, and make them trebly
sincere. If any man, therefore, he would have treated
indulgently Pope: yet his life it is which has mainly
fixed upon Pope that false impression which predominates
at this day&mdash;that doubtless intellectually he was a
very brilliant little man; but morally a spiteful, peevish,
waspish, narrow-hearted cynic. Whereas no imputation
can be more unfounded. Pope, unless in cases when he
had been maddened by lampoons, was a most benignant
creature; and, with the slightest acknowledgment of his
own merit, there never lived a literary man who was so
generously eager to associate others in his own honours&mdash;those
even who had no adequate pretensions. If you,
reader, should, like ourselves, have had occasion to investigate
Pope's life, under an intention of recording it
more accurately or more comprehensively than has yet
been done, you will feel the truth of what we are saying.
And especially we would recommend to every man, who
wishes to think justly of Pope in this respect, that he
should compare his conduct towards literary competitors
with that of Addison. Dr. Johnson, having partially
examined the lives of both, must have been so far qualified
to do justice between them. But justice he has <i>not</i>
done; and to him chiefly we repeat that at this day are
owing the false impressions of Pope's selfish, ungenial,
or misanthropic nature; and the humiliating associations
connected with Pope's petty man&#339;uvring in trivial
domestic affairs, chiefly through Dr. Johnson's means,
will never be obliterated. Let us turn, however, from
Dr. Johnson, whom, with our general respect for his
upright nature, it is painful to follow through circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>stances
where either jealousy (as sometimes) or credulity
and the love of gossip (as very often) has misled him
into gratifying the taste of the envious at a great sacrifice
of dignity to the main upholders of our literature. These
men ought not to have been 'shown up' for a comic or
malicious effect. A nation who value their literature as
we have reason to value ours ought to show their sense
of this value by forgetting the <i>degrading</i> infirmities (not
the venial and human infirmities) of those to whose
admirable endowments they owe its excellence.</p>

<p>Turning away, therefore, from those modes of biography
which have hitherto pursued any vicious extreme, let us
now briefly explain our own ideal of a happier, sounder,
and more ennobling biographical art, having the same
general objects as heretofore, but with a more express
view to the benefit of the reader. Looking even at those
memoirs which, like Hayley's of Cowper, have been
checked by pathetic circumstances from fixing any slur
or irreverential scandal upon their subject, we still see a
great fault in the mass of biographic records; and what
<i>is</i> it? It is&mdash;that, even where no disposition is manifested
to copy either the <i>&eacute;loge</i> or the libellous pasquinade,
too generally the author appears <i>ex officio</i> as
the constant 'patronus' or legal advocate for the person
recorded. And so he ought, if we understand that sort
of advocacy which in English courts the judge was formerly
presumed to exercise on behalf of the defendant
in criminal trials. Before that remarkable change by
which a prisoner was invested with the privilege of
employing separate counsel, the judge was his counsel.
The judge took care that no wrong was done to him;
that no false impression was left with the jury; that the
witnesses against him should not be suffered to run on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
without a sufficient rigour of cross-examination. But
certainly the judge thought it no part of his duty to
make 'the worse appear the better reason'; to throw
dust into the eyes of the jury; or to labour any point of
equivocation for the sake of giving the prisoner an extra
chance of escaping. And, if it is really right that the
prisoner, when obviously guilty, should be aided in
evading his probable conviction, then certainly in past
times he had less than justice. For most undoubtedly
no judge would have attempted what we all saw an
advocate attempting about a year ago, that, when every
person in court was satisfied of the prisoner's guilt, from
the proof suddenly brought to light of his having clandestinely
left the plate of his murdered victim in a particular
party's safe keeping, at that moment the advocate
(though secretly prostrated by this overwhelming discovery)
struggled vainly to fix upon the honourable witness
a foul stigma of self-contradiction and perjury for
the single purpose of turning loose a savage murderer
upon society. If this were not more than justice, then
assuredly in all times past the prisoner had far less.
Now, precisely the difference between the advocacy of the
judge, and the advocacy of a special counsel retained by
the prisoner, expresses the difference which we contemplate
between the biographer as he has hitherto protected
his hero and that biographer whom we would substitute.
Is he not to show a partiality for his subject? Doubtless;
but hitherto, in those lives which have been farthest
from <i>&eacute;loges</i>, the author has thought it his duty to uphold
the general system, polity, or principles upon which
his subject has acted. Thus Middleton and all other
biographers of Cicero, whilst never meditating any panegyrical
account of that statesman, and oftentimes regret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ting
his vanity, for instance, have quite as little thought
it allowable to condemn the main political views, theories,
and consequently actions, of Cicero. But why not? Why
should a biographer be fettered in his choice of subjects
by any imaginary duty of adopting the views held by
him whose life he records? To make war upon the man,
to quarrel with him in every page, <i>that</i> is quite as little
in accordance with our notions; and we have already
explained above our sense of its hatefulness. For then
the question recurs for ever: What necessity forced you
upon a subject whose conduct you thoroughly disapprove?
But let him show the tenderness which is due to a great
man even when he errs. Let him expose the <i>total</i> aberrations
of the man, and make this exposure salutary to
the pathetic wisdom of his readers, not alimentary to
their self-conceit, by keeping constantly before their eyes
the excellence and splendour of the man's powers in
contrast with his continued failures. Let him show such
patronage to the hero of his memoir as the English judge
showed to the poor prisoner at his bar, taking care that
he should suffer no shadow of injustice from the witnesses;
that the prisoner's own self-defence should in no
part be defeated of its effect by want of proper words or
want of proper skill in pressing the forcible points on
the attention of the jury; but otherwise leaving him to
his own real merits in the facts of his case, and allowing
him no relief from the pressure of the hostile evidence
but such as he could find either in counter-evidence or in
the intrinsic weight of his own general character. On
the scheme of biography there would be few persons in
any department of life who would be accompanied to the
close by a bowing and obsequious reporter; there would
be far less of uniform approbation presumable in memoirs;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
but, on the other hand, there would be exhibited pretty
generally a tender spirit of dealing with human infirmities;
a large application of human errors to the benefit
of succeeding generations; and, lastly, there would be
an opening made for the free examination of many lives
which are now in a manner closed against criticism;
whilst to each separate life there would be an access and
an invitation laid bare for minds hitherto feeling themselves
excluded from approaching the subject by imperfect
sympathy with the principles and doctrines which those
lives were supposed to illustrate.</p>

<p>But our reformed view of biography would be better
explained by a sketch applied to Cicero's life or to
Milton's. In either case we might easily show, consistently
with the exposure of enormous errors, that
each was the wisest man of his own day. And with
regard to Cicero in particular, out of his own letters to
Atticus, we might show that every capital opinion which
he held on the politics of Rome in his own day was
false, groundless, contradictory. Yet for all that, we
would engage to leave the reader in a state of far deeper
admiration for the man than the hollow and hypocritical
Middleton ever felt himself, or could therefore have communicated
to his readers.</p>

Courvoisier, in 1840, and this fixes 1841 as the date of the essay.

the plate into the care of an old woman, and making it appear a
burglary. He was defended by a barrister named Philips, who received

court, took Heaven to witness that he believed him innocent, though

<h2><i>XIV. GREAT FORGERS: CHATTERTON AND
WALPOLE, AND 'JUNIUS.'</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>I have ever been disposed to regard as the most venial
of deceptions such impositions as Chatterton had practised
on the public credulity. Whom did he deceive?
Nobody but those who well deserved to be deceived, viz.,
shallow antiquaries, who pretended to a sort of knowledge
which they had not so much as tasted. And it
always struck me as a judicial infatuation in Horace
Walpole, that he, who had so brutally pronounced the
death of this marvellous boy to be a matter of little consequence,
since otherwise he would have come to be hanged
for forgery, should himself, not as a boy under eighteen (and
I think under seventeen at the first issuing of the Rowley
fraud), slaving for a few guineas that he might procure the
simplest food for himself, and then buy presents for the
dear mother and sister whom he had left in Bristol, but
as an elderly man, with a clear six thousand per annum,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
commit a far more deliberate and audacious forgery than
that imputed (if even accurately imputed) to Chatterton.
I know of no published document, or none published
under Chatterton's sanction, in which he formally
<i>declared</i> the Rowley poems to have been the composi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>tions
of a priest living in the days of Henry IV., viz.,
in or about the year 1400. Undoubtedly he suffered
people to understand that he had found MSS. of that
period in the tower of St. Mary Redcliff at Bristol,
which he really <i>had</i> done; and whether he simply
tolerated them in running off with the idea that these
particular poems, written on <i>discoloured</i> parchments by
way of colouring the hoax, were amongst the St. Mary
treasures, or positively <i>said so</i>, in either view, considering
the circumstances of the case, no man of kind feelings
will much condemn him.</p>

<p>But Horace Walpole roundly and audaciously affirmed
in the first sentence of his preface to the poor romance
of 'Otranto,' that it had been translated from the Italian
of Onuphrio Muralto, and that the MS. was still preserved
in the library of an English Catholic family;
circumstantiating his needless falsehood by other most
superfluous details. <i>Needless</i>, I say, because a book
with the Walpole name on the title-page was as sure of
selling as one with Chatterton's obscure name was at
that time sure of <i>not</i> selling. Possibly Horace Walpole
did not care about selling, but wished to measure his
own intrinsic power as a novelist, for which purpose it
was a better course to preserve his <i>incognito.</i> But this
he might have preserved without telling a circumstantial
falsehood. Whereas Chatterton knew that his only
chance of emerging from the obscure station of a grave-digger's
son, and carrying into comfort the dear female
relatives that had half-starved themselves for <i>him</i> (I
speak of things which have since come to my knowledge
thirty-five years after Chatterton and his woes had been
buried in a pauper's coffin), lay in bribing public attention
by some <i>extrinsic</i> attraction. Macpherson had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
recently engaged the public gaze by his 'Ossian'&mdash;an
abortion fathered upon the fourth century after Christ.
What so natural as to attempt other abortions&mdash;ideas and
refinements of the eighteenth century&mdash;referring themselves
to the fifteenth? Had this harmless hoax succeeded,
he would have delivered those from poverty who
delivered <i>him</i> from ignorance; he would have raised those
from the dust who raised <i>him</i> to an aerial height&mdash;yes, to
a height from which (but it was after his death), like
<i>Ate</i> or <i>Eris</i>, come to cause another Trojan war, he threw
down an apple of discord amongst the leading scholars
of England, and seemed to say: 'There, Dean of Exeter!
there, Laureate! there, Tyrwhitt, my man! Me you
have murdered amongst you. Now fight to death for
the boy that living you would not have hired as a
shoeblack. My blood be upon you!' Rise up, martyred
blood! rise to heaven for a testimony against these men
and this generation, or else burrow in the earth, and from
that spring up like the stones thrown by Deucalion and
Pyrrha into harvests of feud, into armies of self-exterminating
foes. Poor child! immortal child! Slight were
thy trespasses on this earth, heavy was thy punishment,
and it is to be hoped, nay, it is certain, that this disproportion
did not escape the eye which, in the algebra of
human actions, estimates <i>both</i> sides of the equation.</p>

<p>Lord Byron was of opinion that people abused Horace
Walpole for several sinister reasons, of which the first is
represented to be that he was a gentleman. Now, I, on
the contrary, am of opinion that he was <i>not</i> always a
gentleman, as particularly seen in his correspondence with
Chatterton. On the other hand, it is but just to recollect
that in retaining Chatterton's MSS. (otherwise an
unfeeling act, yet chiefly imputable to indolence), the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
worst aggravation of the case under the poor boy's construction,
viz., that if Walpole had not known his low
rank 'he would not have dared to treat him in that
way,' though a very natural feeling, was really an unfounded
one. Horace Walpole (I call him so, because
he was not <i>then</i> Lord Orford) certainly had not been
aware that Chatterton was other than a gentleman by
birth and station. The natural dignity of the boy,
which had not condescended to any degrading applications,
misled this practised man of the world. But
recurring to Lord Byron's insinuations as to a systematic
design of running Lord Orford down, I beg to say that
I am no party to any such design. It is not likely that
a furious Conservative like myself, who have the misfortune
also to be the most bigoted of Tories, would be
so. I disclaim all participation in any clamour against
Lord Orford which may have arisen on democratic feeling.
Feeling the profoundest pity for the 'marvellous
boy' of Bristol, and even love, if it be possible to feel
love for one who was in his unhonoured grave before
I was born, I resent the conduct of Lord Orford, in this
one instance, as universally the English public has resented
it. But generally, as a writer, I admire Lord
Orford in a very high degree. As a letter-writer, and
as a brilliant sketcher of social aspects and situations,
he is far superior to any French author who could possibly
be named as a competitor. And as a writer of
personal or anecdotic history, let the reader turn to
Voltaire's 'Si&egrave;cle de Louis Quatorze,' in order to appreciate
his extraordinary merit.</p>

<br />

<p>Next will occur to the reader the forgery of 'Junius.'
Who did <i>that</i>? Oh, villains that have ever doubted since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
'"Junius" Identified'! Oh, scamps&mdash;oh, pitiful scamps!
You, reader, perhaps belong to this wretched corps. But,
if so, understand that you belong to it under false information.
I have heard myriads talk upon this subject.
One man said to me, 'My dear friend, I sympathize with
your fury. You are right. Righter a man cannot be.
Rightest of all men you are.' I was right&mdash;righter&mdash;rightest!
That had happened to few men. But again
this flattering man went on, 'Yes, my excellent friend,
right you are, and evidently Sir Philip Francis was the
man. His backer proved it. The day after his book
appeared, if any man had offered me exactly two thousand
to one in guineas, that Sir Philip was <i>not</i> the man, by
Jupiter! I would have declined the bet. So divine, so
exquisite, so Grecian in its perfection, was the demonstration,
the <i>apodeixis</i> (or what do you call it in Greek?),
that this brilliant Sir Philip&mdash;who, by the way, wore <i>his</i>
order of the Bath as universally as ever he taxed Sir
William Draper with doing&mdash;had been the author of
"Junius." But here lay the perplexity of the matter. At
the least five-and-twenty excellent men proved by posthumous
friends that they, every mother's son of them,
had also perpetrated "Junius."' 'Then they were liars,'
I answered. 'Oh no, my right friend,' he interrupted,
'not liars at all; amiable men, some of whom confessed
on their death-beds (three to my certain knowledge) that,
alas! they had erred against the law of charity. "<i>But
how?</i>" said the clergyman. "Why, by that infernal
magazine of sneers and all uncharitableness, the 'Letters
of Junius.'" "Let me understand you," said the clergyman:
"you wrote 'Junius'?" "Alas! I did," replied
A. Two years after another clergyman said to another
penitent, "And so you wrote 'Junius'?" "Too true,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
my dear sir. Alas! I did," replied B. One year later a
third penitent was going off, and upon the clergyman
saying, "Bless me, is it possible? Did <i>you</i> write
'Junius'?" he replied, "Ah, worshipful sir, you touch a
painful chord in my remembrances&mdash;I now wish I had
not. Alas! reverend sir, I did." Now, you see,' went
on my friend, 'so many men at the New Drop, as you
may say, having with tears and groans taxed themselves
with "Junius" as the climax of their offences, one begins
to think that perhaps <i>all</i> men wrote "Junius."' Well, so
far there was reason. But when my friend contended
also that the proofs arrayed in pamphlets proved the
whole alphabet to have written 'Junius,' I could not
stand his absurdities. Death-bed confessions, I admitted,
were strong. But as to these wretched pamphlets, some
time or other I will muster them all for a field-day; I
will brigade them, as if the general of the district were
coming to review them; and then, if I do not mow them
down to the last man by opening a treacherous battery
of grape-shot, may all my household die under a fiercer
Junius! The true reasons why any man fancies that
'Junius' is an open question must be these three:</p>

<p>First, that they have never read the proofs arrayed
against Sir Philip Francis; this is the general case.</p>

<p>Secondly, that, according to Sancho's proverb, they
want better bread than is made of wheat. They are not
content with proofs or absolute demonstrations. They
require you, like the witch of Endor, to raise Sir Philip
from the grave, that they may cross-examine him.</p>

<p>Thirdly (and this is the fault of the able writer who
unmasked Sir Philip), there happened to be the strongest
argument that ever picked a Bramah-lock against the
unknown writer of 'Junius'; apply this, and if it fits the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
wards, oh, Gemini! my dear friend, but you are right&mdash;righter&mdash;rightest;
you have caught 'Junius' in a rabbit-snare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p><span class="smcap">Editor's Note.</span>&mdash;De Quincey is guilty of a slight lapse of memory in
reference to 'The Castle of Otranto' and Onuphrio Muralto. It was
not in the first sentence of the preface, but on the title-page, that
Walpole so plainly attributed the work to another. The <i>original</i> title-page,
which, of course, was dropped out when it became known to all
the world that Walpole was the author, read thus: 'The Castle of
Otranto: a Story. Translated by William Marshall, Gent. From the
original Italian of Onuphrio Muralto, Canon of the Church of St.
Nicholas, at Otranto. London: printed for Thomas Lownds, in Fleet
Street. 1765.'</p></div>

<h2><i>XV. DANIEL O'CONNELL.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>With a single view to the <i>intellectual</i> pretensions of Mr.
O'Connell, let us turn to his latest General Epistle, dated
from 'Conciliation Hall,' on the last day of October.
This is no random, or (to use a pedantic term) <i>perfunctory</i>
document; not a document is this to which indulgence
is due. By its subject, not less than by its address, it
stands forth audaciously as a deliberate, as a solemn, as
a national state paper; for its subject is the future
political condition of Ireland under the assumption of
Repeal; for its address is, 'To the People of Ireland.'
So placing himself, a writer has it not within his choice
to play the fool; it is not within his competence to tumble
or 'come aloft' or play antics as a mountebank; his
theme binds him to decency, his audience to gravity.
Speaking, though it be but by the windiest of fictions, to
a nation, is not a man pledged to respectful language?
speaking, though it is but by a chimera as wild as Repeal
to a question of national welfare, a man is pledged to
sincerity. Had he seven devils of mockery and banter
within him, for that hour he must silence them all. The
foul fiend must be rebuked, though it were Mahu and
Bohu who should prompt him to buffoonery, when
standing at the bar of nations.</p>

<p>This is the law, this the condition, under which Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
O'Connell was speaking when he issued that recent
address. Given such a case, similar circumstances presupposed,
he could not evade the obligations which they
impose. From such obligations there is no dispensation
to be bought&mdash;no, not at Rome; from the obligations
observe, and those obligations, we repeat, are&mdash;sincerity
in the first place, and respectful or deferential language
in the second. Such were the duties; now let us look to
the performance. And that we may judge of <i>that</i> with
more advantage for searching and appraising the qualities
of this document, permit us to suggest three separate
questions, the first being this: What was the occasion of
the Address? Secondly, what was its ostensible object?
Thirdly, what are the arguments by which, as its means,
the paper travels towards that object?</p>

<p>First, as to the <i>occasion</i> of the Address. We have said
that the date, viz., the 31st of October, is falsified. It
was <i>not</i> dated on the 31st of October, but on or about
the seventh day of November. Even that falsehood,
though at first sight trivial, is enough for suspicion. If
X, a known liar, utters a lie at starting, it is not for him
to plead in mitigation the apparent uselessness of the lie,
it is for us to presume out of the fact a use, where the
fact exists. A leader in the French Revolution protested
often against bloodshed and other atrocities&mdash;not as being
too bad, but, on the contrary, as being too good, too
precious to be wasted upon ordinary occasions. And, on
the same principle, we may be sure that any habitual
liar, who has long found the benefit of falsehoods at his
utmost need, will have formed too profound a reverence
for this powerful resource in a moment of perplexity ever
to throw away a falsehood, or to squander upon a caprice
of the moment that lie which, being seasonably employed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
might have saved him from confusion. The artist in
lying is not the man to lie gratuitously. From the first,
therefore, satisfied ourselves that there was a lurking
motive&mdash;the key to this falsification of date&mdash;we paused
to search it out. In that we found little difficulty. For
what was the professed object of this Address? It was
to meet and to overthrow two notions here represented
as great popular errors. But why at this time? Wherefore
all this heat at the present moment? Grant that
the propositions denounced as erroneous <i>were</i> so in very
deed, why should criminals standing under the shadow
of public vengeance ready to descend, so childishly misuse
the interval, mercifully allowed for their own defence,
in reading lectures upon abstract political speculations,
confessedly bearing no relation to any militant interest
now in question? Quite as impertinent it would be, when
called upon for the answer upon 'Guilty or not Guilty?'
to read a section from the Council of Trent, or a rescript
from Cardinal Bellarmine. Yet the more extravagant
was the logic of this proceeding, the more urgent became
the presumption of a covert motive, and that motive we
soon saw to be this. Let the reader weigh it, and the
good sense of the man who at such a moment could suffer
such a motive to prevail. Thus it is: when Clontarf was
intercepted, and implicitly, though not formally, all
similar meetings were by that one act for ever prohibited,
the first days of terror were naturally occupied with the
panic of the conspirators, and in providing for their
personal terrors. But when the dust of this great uproar
began to settle, and objects again became distinguishable
in natural daylight, the first consequence which struck
the affrighted men of the conspiracy was the chilling
effect of the Government policy upon the O'Connell rent;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
not the weekly rent, applied nobody knows how, but the
annual rent applied to Mr. O'Connell's <i>private</i> benefit.
This was in jeopardy, and on the following argument:
Originally this rent had been levied as a compensation
to Mr. O'Connell in his character of Irish barrister&mdash;not
for services rendered or <i>to be</i> rendered, but for current
services continually being rendered in Parliament from
session to session, for expenses incident to that kind of
duty, and also as an indemnification for the consequent
loss of fees at the Irish Bar. Yet now, in 1843, having
ceased to attend his duty in Parliament, Mr. O'Connell
could no longer claim to that senatorial character. Such
a pretension would be too gross for the understanding
even of a Connaught peasant. And in <i>that</i> there was a
great loss. For the allegation of a Parliamentary warfare,
under the vague idea of pushing forward good bills for
Ireland, or retarding bad ones, had been a pleasant and
easy labour to the parish priests. It was not necessary
to horsewhip<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> their flocks too severely. If all was not
clear to 'my children's' understanding, at least my
children had no mutinous demur in a positive shape
ready for service. Recusants there were, and sturdy
ones, but they could put no face on their guilt, and their
sin was not contagious. Unhappily, from this indefinite
condition of merit Mr. O'Connell himself had translated
his claim to a very distinct one founded upon a clear,
known, absolute attempt to coerce the Government into
passive collusion with prospective treason. This attempt,
said the peasantry, will the Government stand, or will it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>not? 'Why, then,' replied the Government, on the 17th
of October, 'we will <i>not.</i>'</p>

<p>The aristocracy of Ireland may not have done their
duty as regards the Repeal; it is too certain that they
have not, because they have done nothing at all. But it
is also certain that their very uttermost would have been
unavailing for one principal object concerned. Other
great objects, however, might have been attained.
Foreign nations might have been disabused of their silly
delusions on the Irish relations to England, although the
Irish peasantry could <i>not.</i> The monstrous impression
also upon many English and Scotch parties, that a
general unity of sentiment prevailed in Ireland as to the
desirableness of an independent Parliament&mdash;this, this,
we say loudly, would have been dissipated, had every
Irish county met by its gentry disavowing and abominating
all sentiments tending towards a purpose so guilty as
political disunion. Yet, in palliation of this most grievous
failure, we, in the spirit of perfect candour, will remind
our readers of the depressing effect too often attending
one flagrant wound in any system of power or means.
Let a man lose by a sudden blow&mdash;by fire, by shipwreck,
or by commercial failure&mdash;a sum of twenty thousand
pounds, that being four-fifths of his entire property, how
often it is found that mere dejection of mind will incapacitate
him from looking cheerfully after the remaining
fifth! And this though it is now become far more
essential to his welfare; and, secondly, upon a motion
tending upwards and not downwards, he would have
regarded five thousand pounds as a precious treasure
worthy of his efforts, whether for protection or for improvement.
Something analogous to this weighs down
the hearty exertions of the Irish gentry. Met at the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
threshold, affronted at starting, by this insufferable
tyranny of priestly interference&mdash;humiliated and stung
to the heart by the consciousness that those natural
influences which everywhere else settle indefeasibly upon
property, are in Ireland intercepted, filched, violently
robbed and pocketed by a body of professional nuisances
sprung almost universally from paupers&mdash;thus disinherited
of their primary rights, thus pillaged, thus shorn
like Samson of those natural ornaments in which resided
their natural strength, feeling themselves (like that
same Samson in the language of Milton) turned out to
the scorn of their countrymen as 'tame wethers' ridiculously
fleeced and mutilated&mdash;they droop, they languish
as to all public spirit; and whilst by temperament, by
natural endowment, by continual intercourse with the
noble aristocracy of Britain (from whom also they are
chiefly descended), they <i>should</i> be amongst the leading
chivalries of Europe, in very fact they are, for political or
social purposes, the most powerless gentry in existence.
Acting in a corporate capacity, they can do nothing. The
malignant planet of this low-born priesthood comes between
them and the peasantry, eclipsing oftentimes the
sunshine of their comprehensive beneficence, and <i>always</i>
destroying their power to discountenance<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> evil-doers.
Here is the sad excuse. But, for all that, we must affirm
that, if the Irish landed gentry do not yet come forward
to retrieve the ground which they have forfeited by
inertia, history will record them as passive colluders with
the Dublin repealers. The evil is so operatively deep,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>looking backward or forward, that we have purposely
brought it forward in a second aspect, viz., as contrasted
with the London press. For the one, as we have been
showing, there is a strong plea in palliation; for the
other there is none.</p>

<p>Let us be frank. This is what we affirm, that it was,
it is, it will be hereafter, within the powers of the London
press to have extinguished the Repeal or any similar
agitation; they could have done this, and this they have
<i>not</i> done. But let us also not be misunderstood. Do we
say this in a spirit of disrespect? Are we amongst the
parties who (when characterizing the American press)
infamously say, 'Let us, however, look homewards to our
own press, and be silent for very shame'? Are we the
people to join the vicious correspondent of an evening
paper whom but a week ago we saw denouncing the
editor of the <i>Examiner</i> newspaper as a public nuisance,
and recommending him as a fit subject of some degrading
punishment, for no better reason than that he had exercised
his undoubted right of exposing delinquencies or
follies in a garrulous lord? Far be such vilenesses from us.
We honour the press of this country. We know its
constitution, and we know the mere impossibility (were it
only from the great capital required) that any but men
of honour and sensibilities and conspicuous talent, and
men brilliantly accomplished in point of education, should
become writers or editors of a <i>leading</i> journal, or indeed
of any daily journal. Here and there may float <i>in gurgite
vasto</i> some atrocious paper lending itself upon system to
the villainies of private slander. But such a paper is sure
to be an inconsiderable one in the mere sense of property,
and therefore, by a logical consequence in our frame of
society, <i>every</i> way inconsiderable&mdash;rising without effort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
sinking without notice. In fact, the whole staff and
establishment of newspapers have risen in social consideration
within our own generation; and at this
moment not merely proprietors and editors, but reporters
and other ministerial agents to these vast engines of
civility, have all ascended in their superior orders to the
highest levels of authentic responsibility.</p>

<p>We make these acknowledgments in the mere spirit of
equity, and because we disdain to be confounded with
those rash persons who talk glibly of a 'licentious press'
through their own licentious ignorance. Than ignorance
nothing is so licentious for rash saying or for obstinate
denying. The British press is <i>not</i> licentious; neither in
London nor in Edinburgh is it ever licentious; and there
is much need that it should be otherwise, having at this
time so unlimited a power over the public mind. But the
very uprightness of the leading journalists, and all the
other elements of their power, do but constitute the evil,
do but aggravate the mischief, where they happen to go
astray; yes, in every case where these journalists miss
the narrow path of thoughtful prudence. They <i>do</i> miss
it occasionally; they must miss it; and we contend that
they <i>have</i> missed it at present. What they have done
that they ought <i>not</i> to have done. Currency, buoyancy,
they ought <i>not</i> to have impressed upon sedition, upon
conspiracy, upon treason. Currency, buoyancy, they
<i>have</i> impressed upon sedition, upon conspiracy, upon
treason.</p>

<p>As to Mr. O'Connell himself, it is useless, and it argues
some thick darkness of mind, to remonstrate or generally
to address any arguments from whatsoever quarter, which
either appeal to a sense of truth, which, secondly, manifest
inconsistencies, or, thirdly, which argue therein a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
tendency ruinous to himself. Let us think. Burke
asserted of himself, and to our belief truly, that having
at different periods set his face in different directions&mdash;now
to the east, now to the west, now pointing to purposes
of relaxation or liberality, now again to purposes
of coercive and popular restraint&mdash;he had notwithstanding
been uniform, if measured upon a higher scale.
Transcending objects, coinciding neither instantly with
the first, nor except by accident with the last, but indifferently
aided by aristocratic forces or by democratic,
shifting weights which sometimes called for accessories of
gravity, sometimes for subtraction, mighty fluctuating
wheels which sometimes needed flywheels to moderate
or harmonize, sometimes needed concurrent wheels to
urge or aggravate their impetus&mdash;these were the powers
which he had found himself summoned to calculate, to
check, to support, the vast algebraic equation of government;
for this he had strengthened substantially by
apparent contrarieties of policy; and in a system of
watch-work so exquisite as to vary its fine balances
eternally, eternally he had consulted by redressing the
errors emergent, by varying the poise in order that he
might <i>not</i> vary the equipoise, by correcting inequalities,
or by forestalling extremes. That was a man of heroic
build, and of him it might be said at his death, 'Truly
this man was a son of Anak.' Now, of Mr. O'Connell a
man might affirm something similar; that as with regard
to Edmund Burke it is altogether useless to detect contradictions
in form, seeing that he knows of this, that he
justifies this, glories in this, vehemently demands praise
for this contradiction, as all discord is harmony not
understood, planned in the letter and overruled in the
spirit; so may O'Connell say, 'Gentlemen, grubs, rep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>tiles,
vermin, trouble not yourselves to find out contradictions
or discords in my conduct; vex not your slender
faculties by arraying hosts of promises that defeat promises,
or principles that destroy principles&mdash;you shall not
need to labour; I will make you a present of three huge
canisters laden and running over with the flattest denials
in one breath of that which I affirmed in another. But,
like Edmund Burke, I register my conduct by another
table and by its final result. On the dial which you see,
the hands point thus and thus; but upon a higher and
transcendent dial these fingers do but precipitate or
retard one gigantic hand, pointing always and monotonously
to the unity of a perfect selfishness. The everlasting
tacking in my course gives me often the air of
retrograding and losing; but, in fact, these retrogressions
are momentary, these losings of my object are no more
than seeming, are still but the same stealthy creeping
up under cover of frequent compliances with the breeze
that happens to thwart me, towards the one eternal pole
of my own self-interest; that is the pole-star which only
never sets, and I flatter myself that amidst vast apparent
wanderings or multiplied divergences there will be detected
by the eye of the philosopher a consistency in
family objects which is absolute, a divine unity of
selfishness.'</p>

<p>This we do not question. But to will is not to do;
and Mr. O'Connell, with a true loyalty to his one object
of private aims, has <i>not</i> maintained the consistency of
his policy. All men know that he has adventured within
the limits of conspiracy; that could not be for his benefit.
He has touched even the dark penumbra of treason;
that could not but risk the sum of his other strivings.
But he who has failed for himself in a strife so abso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>lute,
for that only must be distrusted by his countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p><span class="smcap">Note by the Editor</span>.&mdash;This article on O'Connell, written in the
end of 1843, is printed, not on account of any political reference it
might be presumed to have, but only because of its historical and
literary interest. Apart from the light it may throw on De Quincey's
leanings, as, in certain respects, distinctly in the direction of patriotic
Toryism of the most rampant type, it may be of value as suggesting
how essentially, in not a few points, the Irish question to-day remains
precisely as it was in the time of O'Connell; and how the Tories of to-day
are apt to view it from precisely the same plane as those of 1843.
It might also be cited as another proof not only of De Quincey's very
keen interest in all the leading questions of the time, but as an illustration
of the John Bull warmth and heat which he, the dreamer, the
recluse, the lover of abstract problems, could bring into such discussions.
Here, at all events, his views were definite enough, and stated with a
bold precision of English plainness that would have pleased the most
pronouncedly Tory or Unionist newspaper editors of that day.</p></div>

<h2><i>XVI. FRANCE PAST AND FRANCE PRESENT.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>To speak in the simplicity of truth, caring not for party
or partisan, is not the France of this day, the France
which has issued from that great furnace of the Revolution,
a better, happier, more hopeful France than the
France of 1788? Allowing for any evil, present or reversionary,
in the political aspects of France, that may yet
give cause for anxiety, can a wise man deny that from
the France of 1840, under Louis Philippe of Orleans,
ascends to heaven a report of far happier days from the
sons and daughters of poverty than from the France of
Louis XVI.? Personally that sixteenth Louis was a good
king, sorrowing for the abuses in the land, and willing
(at least, after affliction had sharpened his reflecting
conscience), had that choice been allowed him, to have
redeemed them by any personal sacrifice. But that was
not possible. Centuries of misrule are not ransomed by
an individual ruin; and had it been possible that the
dark genius of his family, the same who once tolled
funeral knells in the ears of the first Bourbon, and called
him out as a martyr hurrying to meet his own sacrifice&mdash;could
we suppose this gloomy representative of his family
destinies to have met him in some solitary apartment of
the Tuileries or Versailles, some twilight gallery of ancestral
portraits, he could have met him with the purpose
of raising the curtain from before the long series of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
household woes&mdash;from him the king would have learned
that no personal ransom could be accepted for misgovernment
so ancient. Leviathan is not so tamed.
Arrears so vast imply a corresponding accountability,
corresponding by its amount, corresponding by its personal
subjects. Crown and people&mdash;all had erred; all
must suffer. Blood must flow, tears must be shed
through a generation; rivers of lustration must be
thrown through that Augean accumulation of guilt.</p>

<p>And exactly there, it is supposed, lay the error of
Burke; the compass of the penalty, the arch which it
traversed, must bear some proportion to that of the evil
which had produced it.</p>

<p>When I referred to the dark genius of the family who
once tolled funeral knells in the ears of the first Bourbon,
I meant, of course, the first who sat upon the throne of
France, viz., Henri Quatre. The allusion is to the last
hours of Henry's life, to the remarkable prophecies which
foreran his death, to their remarkable fulfilment, and
(what is more remarkable than all beside) to his self-surrender,
in the spirit of an unresisting victim, to a
bloody fate which he regarded as inexorably doomed.
This king was not the good prince whom the French
hold out to us; not even the accomplished, the chivalrous,
the elevated prince to whom history points for one of her
models. French and ultra-French must have been the
ideal of the good or the noble to which he could have
approximated in the estimate of the most thoughtless.
He had that sort of military courage which was, and is,
more common than weeds. In all else he was a low-minded
man, vulgar in his thoughts, most unprincely
in his habits. He was even worse than that: wicked,
brutal, sensually cruel. And his wicked minister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Sully, than whom a more servile mind never existed,
illustrates in one passage his own character and his
master's by the apology which he offers for Henry's
having notoriously left many illegitimate children to
perish of hunger, together with their too-confiding
mothers. What? That in the pressure of business he
really forgot them. Famine mocked at last the deadliest
offence. His own innocent children, up and down
France, because they were illegitimate, their too-confiding
mothers, because they were weak and friendless by
having for his sake forfeited the favour of God and man,
this amiable king had left to perish of hunger. They <i>did</i>
perish; mother and infant. A cry ascended against the
king. Even in sensual France such atrocities could not
utterly sink to the ground. But what says the apologetic
minister? Astonished that anybody could think of
abridging a king's license in such particulars, he brushes
away the whole charge as so much ungentlemanly
impertinence, disdaining any further plea than the
pressure of business, which so naturally accounted for
the royal inattention or forgetfulness in these little affairs.
Observe that this pressure of business never was such
that the king could not find time for pursuing these
intrigues and multiplying these reversions of woe. What
enormities! A king (at all times of Navarre, and for
half his life of France) suffers his children to die of
hunger, consigns their mothers to the same fate, but
aggravated by remorse and by the spectacle of their
perishing infants! These clamours could not penetrate
to the Louvre, but they penetrated to a higher court,
and were written in books from which there is no erasure
allowed. So much for the vaunted 'generosity' of
Henry IV. As to another feature of the chivalrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
character, elegance of manners, let the reader consult
the report of an English ambassador, a man of honour
and a gentleman, Sir George Carew. It was published
about the middle of the last century by the indefatigable
Birch, to whom our historic literature is so much indebted,
and it proves sufficiently that this idol of Frenchmen
allowed himself in habits so coarse as to disgust
the most creeping of his own courtiers; such that even
the blackguards of a manly nation would revolt from
them as foul and self-dishonouring. Deep and permanent
is the mischief wrought in a nation by false models; and
corresponding is the impression, immortal the benefit,
from good ones. The English people have been the
better for their Alfred, that pathetic ideal of a good king,
through a space of now nearly a thousand years. The
French are the worse to this hour in consequence of
Francis I. and Henry IV. And note this, that even
the spurious merit of the two French models can be
sustained only by disguises, by suppressions, by elaborate
varnishings; whereas the English prince is offered to
our admiration with a Scriptural simplicity and a Scriptural
fidelity, not as some gay legend of romance, some
Telemachus of F&eacute;nelon, but as one who had erred,
suffered, and had been purified; as a shepherd that had
gone astray, and saw that through his transgressions the
flock also had been scattered.</p>

<h2><i>XVII. ROME'S RECRUITS AND ENGLAND'S
RECRUITS.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Two facts on which a sound estimate of the Roman
corn-trade depends are these: first, the very important
one, that it was not Rome in the sense of the Italian
peninsula which relied upon foreign corn, but in the
narrowest sense Rome the city; as respected what we
now call Lombardy, Florence, Genoa, etc., Rome did
not disturb the ancient agriculture. The other fact
offers, perhaps, a still more important consideration.
Rome was latterly a most populous city&mdash;we are disposed
to agree with Lipsius, that it was four times as populous
as most moderns esteem&mdash;most certainly it bore a higher
ratio to the total Italy than any other capital (even
London) has since borne to the territory over which it
presided. Consequently it will be argued that in such a
ratio must the foreign importations of Rome, even in the
limited sense of Rome the city, have operated more destructively
upon the domestic agriculture. Grant that
not Italy, but Rome, was the main importer of foreign
grain, still, if Rome to all Italy were as one to four in
population, which there is good reason to believe it was,
then even upon that distinction it will be insisted that
the Roman importation crushed one-fourth of the native<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
agriculture. Now, this we deny. Some part of the
African and Egyptian grain was but a substitution for
the Sardinian, and so far made no difference to Italy in
ploughs, but only in <i>denarii.</i> But the main consideration
of all is, that the Italian grain was not withdrawn from
the vast population of Rome&mdash;this is <i>not</i> the logic of the
case&mdash;no; on the contrary, the vast population of Rome
arose and supervened as a consequence upon the opening
of the foreign Alexandrian corn trade. It was not Rome
that quirted the home agriculture. Rome, in the full
sense, never would have existed without foreign supplies.
If, therefore, Rome, by means of foreign grain, rose from
four hundred thousand heads to four millions, then it
follows that (except as to the original demand for the
four hundred thousand) not one plough was disused in
Italy that ever had been used. Whilst, even with regard
to the original demand of the four hundred thousand,
by so much of the Egyptian grain as had been a mere
substitution for Sardinian no effect whatever could have
followed to Italian agriculture.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, we see the many limitations which
arise to the modern doctrine upon the destructive agricultural
consequences of the Roman corn trade. Rome may
have prevented the Italian agriculture from expanding,
but she could not have caused it to decline.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Now, let
us see how far this Roman corn trade affected the Roman
recruiting service. It is alleged that agriculture declined
under the foreign corn trade, and that for this reason
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ploughmen declined. But if we have shown cause for
doubting whether agriculture declined, or only did not
increase, then we are at liberty to infer that ploughmen
did not decline, but only did not increase. Even of the
real and not imaginary ploughmen at any time possessed
by Italy, too many in the south were slaves, and therefore
ineligible for the legionary service, except in desperate
intestine struggles like the Social war or the Servile.
Rome could not lose for her recruiting service any
ploughmen but those whom she had really possessed;
nor out of those whom really she possessed any that
were slaves; nor out of those whom (not being slaves)
she <i>might</i> have used for soldiers could it be said that she
was liable to any absolute loss except as to those whom
ordinarily she <i>did</i> use as soldiers, and preferred to use in
circumstances of free choice.</p>

<p>These points premised, we go on to say that no craze
current amongst learned men has more deeply disturbed
the truth of history than the notion that 'Marsi' and
'Peligni,' or other big-boned Italian rustics, ever by
choice constituted the general or even the favourite recruiting
fund of the Roman republic. In thousands of
books we have seen it asserted or assumed that the
Romans triumphed so extensively chiefly because their
armies were composed of Roman or kindred blood. This
is false. Not the material, but the military system, of
the Romans was the true key to their astonishing successes.
In the time of Hannibal a Roman consul relied
chiefly, it is true, upon Italian recruits, because he could
seldom look for men of other blood. And it is possible
enough that the same man, Fabius or Marcellus, if he
had been sent abroad as a proconsul, might find his
choice even then in what formerly had been his necessity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
In some respects it is probable that the Italian rustic of
true Italian blood was at that period the best raw
material<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> easily procured for the legionary soldier. But
circumstances altered; as the range of war expanded to
the East it became far too costly to recruit in Italy; nor,
if it had been less costly, could Italy have supplied the
waste. Above all, with the advantages of the Roman
military system, no particular physical material was required
for making good soldiers. For these reasons it
was that, after the Levant was permanently occupied
by the Romans, where any legion had been originally
stationed <i>there</i> it continued to be stationed, and <i>there</i> it
was recruited, and, unless in some rare emergency of a
critical war arising at a distance, <i>there</i> it was so continually
recruited, that in the lapse of a generation it
contained hardly any Roman or Italian blood in its composition,
like the Attic ship which had been repaired
with cedar until it retained no fragment of its original
oak. Thus, the legion stationed at Antioch became entirely
Syrian; that stationed at Alexandria, Grecian,
Jewish, and, in a separate sense, Alexandrine. C&aelig;sar, it is
notorious, raised one entire legion of Gauls (distinguished
by the cognizance upon the helmet of the <i>lark</i>, whence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>commonly called the legion of the <i>Alauda</i>). But he recruited
all his legions in Gaul. In Spain the armies of
Assanius and Petreius, who surrendered to C&aelig;sar under
a convention, consisted chiefly of Spaniards (not <i>Hispanienses</i>,
or Romans born in Spain, but <i>Hispani</i>,
Spaniards by blood); at Pharsalia a large part of C&aelig;sar's
army were Gauls, and of Pompey's it is well known
that many even amongst the legions contained no
Europeans at all, but (as C&aelig;sar seasonably reminded his
army) consisted of vagabonds from every part of the
East. From all this we argue that <i>S.P.Q.R.</i> did not
depend latterly upon native recruiting. And, in fact,
they did not need to do so; their system and discipline
would have made good soldiers out of mop-handles, if
(like Lucian's magical mop-handles) they could only
have learned to march and to fill buckets with water at
the word of command.</p>

<p>We see, too, the secret power and also the secret
political wisdom of Christianity in another instance.
Those public largesses of grain, which, in old Rome, commenced
upon principles of ambition and of factious encouragement
to partisans, in the new Rome of Constantinople
were propagated for ages under the novel
motive of Christian charity to paupers. This practice
has been condemned by the whole chorus of historians
who fancy that from this cause the domestic agriculture
languished, and that a bounty was given upon pauperism.
But these are reveries of literary men. That
particular section of rural industry which languished
in Italy, did so by a reaction from <i>rent</i> in the severe
modern sense. The grain imported from Sardinia, from
Africa the province, and from Egypt, was grown upon
soils less costly, because with equal cost more productive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The effect upon Italy from bringing back any considerable
portion of this provincial corn-growth<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to her domestic
districts would have been suddenly to develop rent upon
a large series of evils, and to load the provincial grain
as well as the home-grown&mdash;the cheap provincial as well
as the dear home-grown&mdash;with the whole difference of
these new costs. Neither is the policy of the case at all
analogous to our own at the moment. In three circumstances
it differs essentially:</p>

<p>First, provinces are not foreigners; colonies are not
enemies. An exotic corn-trade could not for Rome do
the two great injuries which assuredly it would do for
England; it could not transfer the machinery of opulence
to a hostile and rival state; it could not invest a jealous
competitor with power suddenly to cut off supplies that
had grown into a necessity, and thus to create in one
month a famine or an insurrection. Egypt had neither
the power nor any prospect of the power to act as an
independent state towards Rome; the transfer to Egypt
of the Roman agriculture, supposing it to have been
greater than it really was, could have operated but like a
transfer from Norfolk to Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Secondly, as respected Italy, the foreign grain <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span><i>did not
enter the same markets as the native.</i> Either one or the
other would have lost its advantage, and the natural
bounty which it enjoyed from circumstances, by doing
so. Consequently the evils of an artificial scale, where
grain raised under one set of circumstances fixes or
modifies the price for grain raised under a different set
of circumstances, were unknown in the Italian markets.
But these evils by a special machinery, viz., the machinery
of good and bad seasons, are aggravated for a modern
state intensely, whenever she depends too much upon
alien stores; and specifically they are aggravated by the
fact that both grains <i>enter the same market</i>, so that the
one by too high a price is encouraged unreasonably, the
other by the same price (too low for opposite circumstances)
is depressed ruinously as regards coming
years; whence in the end two sets of disturbances&mdash;one
set frequently from the <i>present</i> seasons, and a second
set from the way in which these are made to act upon
the <i>future</i> markets.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Roman corn-trade did not of necessity
affect her military service injuriously, and for this reason,
that rural economy did not of necessity languish because
agriculture languished locally; some other culture, as of
vineyards, <i>oliveta</i>, orchards, pastures, replaced the declining
culture of grain; if ploughmen were fewer, other
labourers were more. It is forgotten, besides, that the
decline of Italian agriculture, never more than local, was
exceedingly gradual; for two hundred and fifty years
before the Christian era Italy never <i>had</i> depended exclusively
upon herself. Sardinia and Sicily, at her own
doors, were her granaries; consequently the change
never <i>had</i> been that abrupt change which modern writers
imagine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us indulge in the luxury of confirming what we
have said by the light of contrast. Suppose the circumstances
changed, suppose them reversed, and then all
those evil consequence sought to take effect which in the
case of Rome we have denied. Now, it happened that
they <i>were</i> reversed; not, indeed, for Rome, who had
been herself ruined as metropolis of the West before the
effects of a foreign corn-dependence could unfold themselves,
but for her daughter and rival in the East. Early
in the seventh century, near to the very crisis of the
Hegira (which dates from the Christian year 622), Constantinople,
Eastern Rome, suddenly became acquainted with
the panic of famine. In one hour perhaps this change
fell upon the imperial city, and, but for the imperial
granaries, not the panic of famine, but famine itself, would
have surprised the imperial city; for the suddenness of
the calamity would have allowed no means of searching
out or raising up a relief to it. At that time the greatest
man who ever occupied the chair of the Eastern C&aelig;sars,
viz., Heraclius,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> was at the head of affairs. But the
perplexity was such that no man could face it. On the
one hand Constantine, the founder of this junior Rome,
had settled upon the houses of the city a claim for a
weekly <i>dimensum</i> of grain. Upon this they relied; so
that doubly the Government stood pledged&mdash;first, for the
importation of corn that should be sufficient; secondly,
for its distribution upon terms as near to those of Constantine
as possible. But, on the other hand, Persia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>(the one great stationary enemy of the empire) had in
the year 618 suddenly overrun Egypt; grain became deficient
on the banks of the Nile&mdash;had it even been
plentiful, to so detested an enemy it would have been
denied&mdash;and thus, without a month's warning, the supply,
which had not failed since the inauguration of the city
in 330, ceased in one week. The people of this mighty
city were pressed by the heaviest of afflictions. The
emperor, under false expectations, was tempted into
making engagements which he could not keep; the
Government, at a period which otherwise and for many
years to come was one of awful crisis, became partially
insolvent; the shepherd was dishonoured, the flocks were
ruined; and had that Persian armament which about
ten years later laid siege to Constantinople then stood at
her gates, the Cross would have been trampled on by
the fire-worshipping idolater, and the barbarous Avar
would have desolated the walls of the glorified C&aelig;sar
who first saw Christ marching in the van of Roman
armies. Such an iliad of woes would have expanded
itself <i>seriatim</i>, and by a long procession, from the one
original mischief of depending for daily bread upon those
who might suddenly become enemies or tools of enemies.
England! read in the distress of that great C&aelig;sar,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>may with propriety be called the earliest (as he was the
most prosperous) of Crusaders, read in the internal
struggle of his heart&mdash;too conscious that dishonour had
settled upon his purple&mdash;read in the degradations which
he traversed as some fiery furnace (yet not unsinged), the
inevitable curses which await nations who sacrifice, for a
momentary convenience of bread, sacrifice for a loaf, the
charter of their supremacy! This is literally to fulfil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>the Scriptural case of selling a birthright for a mess of
pottage.</p>

<p>For England we may say of this case&mdash;<i>Transeat in
exemplum!</i></p>

<p>Great Britain, on the contrary, is limited in her recruiting-grounds
by modern political relations as respects
Europe: she <i>has</i> formed an excellent foreign corps long
ago in the Mediterranean; a Hessian corps in America;
an admirable Hanoverian legion during the late war.
But circumstances too often prevent her relying (as the
Romans did) on the perfection of her military <i>system</i> so
far as to dispense with native materials; except, indeed,
in the East, where the Roman principle is carried out to
the widest extent, needing only one-tenth of British by
way of model and inspiration under circumstances of
peculiar trial! In African stations also, in the West
Indies and on the American continent (as in Honduras),
England proceeds (though insufficiently) upon this fine
Roman principle, making her theory, her discipline, and
the network of her rules do the work of her own too
costly hands. She, like Rome, finds the benefit of her
fine system chiefly in the dispensation which it facilitates
from working with any exhaustible fund of means. Excellent
must be that workmanship which can afford to be
careless about its materials; yet still&mdash;where naturally
and essentially it must be said that <i>materiem superabat
opus</i>, because one section of our martial service moves by
nautical soldiers, and with respect to the other half because
it is necessary to meet European troops by men of
British blood&mdash;we cannot, for European purposes, look to
any other districts than our own native <i>officin&aelig;</i> of population.
The Life Guards (1st regiment) and the Blues
(2nd) recruit chiefly, or did so thirty years ago, in York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>shire.
This is a manufacturing county, though in a
mode of manufacturing which escapes many evils of the
factory system. And generally we are little disposed
pedantically to disparage towns as funds of a good
soldiery. Men of mighty bone and thews, sons of Anak,
to our own certain knowledge, arise in Kendal, Wakefield,
Bradford and Leeds; huge men, by thousands,
amongst the spinners and weavers of Glasgow, Paisley,
etc., well able to fight their way through battalions of
clod-hoppers whose talk is of oxen. But, unless in times
subject to special distress, it is not so easy to tempt away
the weaver from his loom as the delver from his spade.
We believe the reason to be, that the monotony of a
rustic life is more oppressive to those who have limited
resources than the corresponding monotony of a town
life. For this reason, and for many others, it is certain&mdash;and
perhaps (unless we get to fighting with steam-men)
it will continue to be certain through centuries&mdash;that, for
the main staple of her armies and her navies, England
must depend upon the quality of her bold peasantry and
noble yeomanry; for we must remember that, of those
huge-limbed men who are found in the six northern
counties of England and in the Scottish Lowlands, of
those elegantly-formed men who are found in Devonshire,
Cornwall, etc., of those <i>hardy</i> men (a feature in
human physics still more important) who are found in
every district&mdash;if many are now resident in towns, most
of them originated in rustic life; and from rustic life it
is that the reservoir of towns is permanently fed. Rome
was, England never will be, independent of her rural
population. Rome never had a yeomanry, Rome never
had a race of country gentlemen; England has both
upon a scale so truly noble that it will be the simplest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
expression of that nobility to say, pointing to our villages,
'Behold the cradle of our army!' as inversely to say, pointing
to that army: 'Behold the manhood of our villages!'
As regards Rome, from the bisection of the Roman territory
into two several corn districts depending upon a separate
agriculture, it results that <i>her</i> wealth could not be
defeated and transferred; secondly, it results from the
total subjection of Egypt, that no embargo <i>could</i> be
laid on the harvests of the Nile, and no famine <i>could</i> be
organized against Rome; thirdly, it results that the
Roman military system was thus not liable to be affected
by any dependency upon foreign grain. On the argument
that this dependency had <i>always</i> been proceeding gradually
in Italy, so as virtually to reimburse itself by <i>vicarious</i>
culture, whereas in England the transition from
independency to dependency, being accomplished (if at
all) in one day by Act of Parliament, would be ruinously
abrupt; and also on the argument <i>B</i>, that Rome, if
slowly losing any recruiting districts at home, found
compensatory districts all round the Mediterranean,
whilst England could find no such compensatory districts&mdash;we
deny that the circumstances of the Roman
corn trade have <i>ever</i> been stated truly; and we expect the
thanks of our readers for drawing their attention to this
outline of the points which essentially differenced it from
the modern corn trade of England. England must, but
Rome could <i>not</i>, reap from a foreign corn dependency:
firstly, ruinous disturbance to the natural expansions of
her wealth; secondly, famine by intervals for her vast
population; thirdly, impoverishment to her recruiting
service. These are the dreadful evils (some uniform,
some contingent) which England would inherit of her
native agriculture, but which Rome escaped under that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
partial transfer, never really accomplished. Meantime,
let the reader remember that it is Rome, and not England&mdash;Rome
historically, not England politically&mdash;which
forms the <i>object</i> of our exposure. England is but the
<i>means</i> of the illustration.</p>

<p>In our own days wars in their ebbs and flows are but
another name for the resources of the national exchequer,
or expressions of its artificial facilities for turning those
resources to account. The great artifice of anticipation
applied to national income&mdash;an artifice sure to follow
where civilization has expanded, and which would have
arisen to Rome had her civilization been either (<i>A</i>) completely
developed, or (<i>B</i>) expanded originally from a true
radix&mdash;has introduced a new era into national history.
The man who, having had property, invests in the Funds,
and divides between his grandchildren and the five subsequent
generations what will yield them subsistence, is
the author of an expansive improvement which has been
enjoyed by all in turn, and with more fixed assurance in
the last case than in the first. He is a public benefactor
in more ways than appears on the surface: he takes the
most efficient guarantees against needless wars.</p>

<p>Captain Jenkins's ears<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> might have been redeemed at
a less price; but still the war taught a lesson, which, if
avoidable at that instant, was certainly blamable; but it
had its use in enforcing on other nations the conviction
that England washed out insult with retribution, and for
every drop of blood wantonly spilt demanded an ocean in
return. Perhaps you will say <i>this</i> was no great improvement
on the old. No; not in <i>appearance</i>, it may be;
but that was because war had to open a field which mere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>diplomacy, unsupported by the sword, could not open,
and secured what we may well call a <i>moral</i> result in the
eye of the whole world, which diplomacy could not
secure in our guilty Europe. But was that, you ask, a
condition to be contemplated with complete satisfaction?
No; nor is it right that it should. But the dawn of a
new era is approaching, for which that may have done
its instalment of preparation. Not that war will cease
for many generations, but that it will continually move
more in greater subjection to national laws and Christian
opinion. Nevermore will it be excited by mere court
intrigue, or even by ministerial necessities. No more
will a quarrel between two ladies about a pair of gloves,
or a fit of ill-temper in a prince toward his minister, call
forth the dread scourge by way of letting off personal
irritation or redressing the balance of parties.</p>

<p><i>Funding</i>, therefore, was a great step in advance; and
even already we have only to look into the Exchequer in
order to read the possibilities, the ebbs and flows of war
beforehand. This consideration of money, it is true&mdash;even
as the sinews of war&mdash;was not so great in ancient
history. And the reason is evident. Kings did not then
go to war <i>by</i> money, but <i>for</i> money. They did not look
into the Exchequer for the means of a campaign, but
they looked into a campaign for the means of an Exchequer.
Yet even in these nations, more of their history, of their
doings and sufferings, lay in their economy than anywhere
else. The great Oriental phantoms, such as the
Pharaohs and the Sargons, did, it is true, bring nations
to war without much more care for the commissariat
department than is given in the battles of the Kites and
Daws. Yet even there the political economy made itself
felt, obscurely and indirectly it may be, but really and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
effectively, acting by laws that varied their force rather
to the eye than to the understanding, and presented indeed
a final restraining force to these kings also. For
examine these wars, fabulous as they are; look into the
when, the whence, the how; into the duration of the
campaigns, into their objects, and into the quality of
the troops, into the circumstances under which they were
trained and fought, and this will abundantly appear.</p>

<p>Certainly, the commissariat which we do by foresight,
they did by brute efforts of power; but the leading
economical laws which are now clear to us, and which,
with full perception of their inevitable operation, we take
into account, made themselves felt in the last result if
only then blindly realized; and in the fact that these
laws are now clearly apprehended lies the prevailing
reason that modern wars must, on the side alike of the
commissariat and of social effects in various directions,
be widely different from war in ancient times.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> One pretended proof of a decline is found in the supposed substitution
of slave labour for free Italian labour. This began, it is urged, on
the opening of the Nile corn trade. Unfortunately, that is a mere
romance. Ovid, describing rural appearances in Italy when as yet the
trade was hardly in its infancy, speaks of the rustic labourer as working
in fetters. Juvenal, in an age when the trade had been vastly expanded,
notices the same phenomenon almost in the same terms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> 'The best raw material.' Some people hold that the Romans and
Italians were a cowardly nation. We doubt this on the whole. Physically,
however, they were inferior to their neighbours. It is certain
that the Transalpine Gauls were a conspicuously taller race. C&aelig;sar
says: 'Gallis, pr&aelig; magnitudine corporum quorum, brevitas nostra contemptui
est' ('Bell. Gall.' 2, 30 <i>fin.</i>); and the Germans, in a still
higher degree, were both larger men and every way more powerful.
The kites, says Juvenal, had never feasted on carcases so huge as those
of the Cimbri and Teutones. But this physical superiority, though
great for special purposes, was not such absolutely. For the more
general uses of the legionary soldier, for marching, for castrametation,
and the daily labours of the spade or mattock, a lighter build was
better. As to single combats, it was one effect from the Roman (as
from every good) discipline&mdash;that it diminished the openings for such
showy but perilous modes of contest.</p></div>

the provincial culture which was pursued on account of Rome, meaning
not the government of Rome, but, in a rigorous sense, on account of
Rome the city. For here lies a great oversight of historians and
economists. Because Rome, with a view to her own <i>privileged</i> population,
<i>i.e.</i>, the urban population of Rome, the metropolis, in order that
she might support her public distributions of grain, almost of necessity
depended on foreign supplies, <i>we are not to suppose that the great mass
of Italian towns and municipia did so.</i> Maritime towns, having the
benefit of ports or of convenient access, undoubtedly were participators
in the Roman advantage. But inland towns would in those days have
forfeited the whole difference between foreign and domestic grain by
the enormous cost of inland carriage. Of canals there was but one;
the rivers were not generally navigable, and ports as well as river
shipping were wanting.</p></div>

could not have followed what we venture to believe the suggestions
of his heart, in relation to his predecessor, because a policy had been
established which made it dangerous to be merciful, and a state of
public feeling which made it effeminate to pardon. First make it safe
to permit a man's life, before you pronounce it ignoble to authorize his
death. Strip mercy of ruin to its author, before you affirm upon a
judicial punishment of death (as then it was) cruelty in the adviser or
ignobility in the approver. Escaping from these painful scenes at the
threshold of his public life, we find Heraclius preparing for a war, the
most difficult that in any age any hero has confronted. We call him
the earliest of Crusaders, because he first and <i>literally</i> fought for the
recovery of the Cross. We call him the most prosperous of Crusaders,
because he first&mdash;he last&mdash;succeeded in all that he sought, bringing
back to Syria (ultimately to Constantinople) that sublime symbol of
victorious Christianity which had been disgracefully lost at Jerusalem.
Yet why, when comparing him not with Crusaders, but with C&aelig;sars, do
we pronounce him the noblest? Reader, which is it that is felt by a
thoughtful man&mdash;supposing him called upon to select one act by preference
before all others&mdash;to be the grandest act of our own Wellesley?
Is it not the sagacious preparation of the lines at Torres Vedras, the
self-mastery which lured the French on to their ruin, the long-suffering
policy which reined up his troops till that ruin was accomplished? '<i>I
bide my time</i>,' was the dreadful watchword of Wellington through
that great drama; in which, let us tell the French critics on Tragedy,
they will find <i>the most</i> absolute unity of plot; for the forming of the
lines as the fatal noose, the wiling back the enemy, the pursuit when
the work of disorganization was perfect, all were parts of one and the
same drama. If he (as another Scipio) saw another Zama, in this
instance he was not our Scipio or Marcellus, but our Fabius Maximus:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.'&mdash;'Ann.' 8, 27.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Now, such was the Emperor Heraclius. He also had his avenging Zama.
But, during a memorable interval of eleven years, he held back;
fiercely reined up his wrath; brooded; smiled often balefully;
watched in his lair; and then, when the hour had struck, let slip
his armies and his thunderbolts as no C&aelig;sar had ever done, except that
one who founded the name of C&aelig;sar.</p></div>

<h2><i>XVIII. NATIONAL MANNERS AND FALSE
JUDGMENT OF THEM.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Anecdotes illustrative of manners, above all of national
manners, will be found on examination, in a far larger
proportion than might be supposed, rank falsehoods.
Malice is the secret foundation of all anecdotes in that
class. The ordinary course of such falsehoods is, that
first of all some stranger and alien to those feelings which
have prompted a particular usage&mdash;incapable, therefore,
of entering fully into its spirit or meaning&mdash;tries to exhibit
its absurdity more forcibly by pushing it into an
extreme or trying case. Coming himself from some
gross form of <i>Kleinst&auml;dtigkeit</i>, where no restraints of
decorum exist, and where everybody speaks to everybody,
he has been utterly confounded by the English ceremony
of 'introduction,' when enforced as the <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> condition
of personal intercourse. If England is right, then
how clownishly wrong must have been his own previous
circles! If England is not ridiculously fastidious, then
how bestially grovelling must be the spirit of social intercourse
in his own land! But no man reconciles himself
to this view of things in a moment. He kicks even
against his own secret convictions. He blushes with
shame and anger at the thought of his own family perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
brought suddenly into collision with polished Englishmen;
he thrills with wrath at the recollection of having
himself trespassed upon this code of restriction at a time
when he was yet unwarned of its existence. In this
temper he is little qualified to review such a regulation
with reason and good sense. He seeks to make it appear
ridiculous. He presses it into violent cases for which it
was never intended. He supposes a case where some
fellow-creature is drowning. How would an Englishman
act, how <i>could</i> he act, even under such circumstances as
these? <i>We</i> know, we who are blinded by no spite, that
as a bar to personal communication or to any interchange
of good offices under appeals so forcible as these, this law
of formal presentation between the parties never did and
never will operate. The whole motive to such a law
gives way at once.</p>

<h2><i>XIX. INCREASED POSSIBILITIES OF SYMPATHY<br />
IN THE PRESENT AGE.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Some years ago I had occasion to remark that a new era
was coming on by hasty strides for national politics, a
new organ was maturing itself for public effects. Sympathy&mdash;how
great a power is that! Conscious sympathy&mdash;how
immeasurable! Now, for the total development
of this power, <i>time</i> is the most critical of elements.
Thirty years ago, when the Edinburgh mail took ninety-six
hours in its transit from London, how slow was the
reaction of the Scottish capital upon the English! Eight
days for the <i>diaulos</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of the journey, and two, suppose,
for getting up a public meeting, composed a cycle of <i>ten</i>
before an act received its commentary, before a speech
received its refutation, or an appeal its damnatory
answer. What was the consequence? The sound was
disconnected from its echo, the kick was severed from
the recalcitration, the '<i>Take you this!</i>' was unlinked
from the '<i>And take you that!</i>' Vengeance was defeated,
and sympathy dissolved into the air. But now mark the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>difference. A meeting on Monday in Liverpool is by
possibility reported in the London <i>Standard</i> of Monday
evening. On Tuesday, the splendid merchant, suppose
his name were Thomas Sands, who had just sent a
vibration through all the pulses of Liverpool, of Manchester,
of Warrington, sees this great rolling fire (which
hardly yet has reached his own outlying neighbourhoods)
taken up afar off, redoubled, multiplied, peal after peal,
through the vast artilleries of London. Back comes
rolling upon him the smoke and the thunder&mdash;the defiance
to the slanderer and the warning to the offender&mdash;groans
that have been extorted from wounded honour, aspirations
rising from the fervent heart&mdash;truth that had been
hidden, wisdom that challenged co-operation.</p>

<p>And thus it is that all the nation, thus 'all that mighty
heart,' through nine hundred miles of space, from Sutherlandshire
by London to the myrtle climate of Cornwall,
has become and is ever more becoming one infinite harp,
swept by the same breeze of sentiment, reverberating the
same sympathies</p>

</div></div>

<p>Time, therefore, that ancient enemy of man and his
frail purposes, how potent an ally has it become in combination
with great mechanic changes! Many an imperfect
hemisphere of thought, action, desire, that could
not heretofore unite with its corresponding hemisphere,
because separated by ten or fourteen days of suspense,
now moves electrically to its integration, hurries to its
complement, realizes its orbicular perfection, spherical
completion, through that simple series of improvements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>which to man have given the wings and <i>talaria</i> of Gods,
for the heralds have dimly suggested a future rivalship
with the velocities of light, and even now have inaugurated
a race between the child of mortality and the North
Wind.</p>

<h2><i>XX. THE PRINCIPLE OF EVIL.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>We are not to suppose the rebel, or, more properly, corrupted
angels&mdash;the rebellion being in the result, not in
the intention (which is as little conceivable in an exalted
spirit as that man should prepare to make war on gravitation)&mdash;were
essentially evil. Whether a principle of
evil&mdash;essential evil&mdash;anywhere exists can only be guessed.
So gloomy an idea is shut up from man. Yet, if so,
possibly the angels and man were nearing it continually.</p>

<p>Possibly after a certain approach to that Maelstrom
recall might be hopeless. Possibly many anchors had
been thrown out to pick up, had all dragged, and last of
all came to the Jewish trial. (Of course, under the
Pagan absence of sin, <i>a fall was impossible.</i> A return
was impossible, in the sense that you cannot return to a
place which you have never left. Have I ever noticed
this?) We are not to suppose that the angels were
really in a state of rebellion. So far from that, it was
evidently amongst the purposes of God that what are
called false Gods, and are so in the ultimate sense of
resting on tainted principles and tending to ruin&mdash;perhaps
irretrievable (though it would be the same thing practically
if no restoration were possible but through vast
&aelig;ons of unhappy incarnations)&mdash;but otherwise were as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
real as anything can be into whose nature a germ of evil
has entered, should effect a secondary ministration of
the last importance to man's welfare. Doubt there can be
little that without any religion, any sense of dependency,
or gratitude, or reverence as to superior natures, man
would rapidly have deteriorated; and that would have
tended to such destruction of all nobler principles&mdash;patriotism
(strong in the old world as with us), humanity,
ties of parentage or neighbourhood&mdash;as would soon have
thinned the world; so that the Jewish process thus
going on must have failed for want of correspondencies to
the scheme&mdash;possibly endless oscillations which, however
coincident with plagues, would extirpate the human race.
We may see in manufacturing neighbourhoods, so long
as no dependency exists on masters, where wages show
that not work, but workmen, are scarce, how unamiable,
insolent, fierce, are the people; the poor cottagers on a
great estate may sometimes offend you by too obsequious
a spirit towards all gentry. That was a transition state
in England during the first half of the eighteenth century,
when few manufacturers and merchants had risen to
such a generous model. But this leaves room for many
domestic virtues that would suffer greatly in the other
state. Yet this is but a faint image of the total independency.
Oaths were sacred only through the temporal
judgments supposed to overtake those who insulted the
Gods by summoning them to witness a false contract.
But this would have been only part of the evil. So long
as men acknowledged higher natures, they were doubtful
about futurity. This doubt had little strength on the
side of hope, but much on the side of fear. The blessings
of any future state were cheerless and insipid mockeries;
so Achilles&mdash;how he bemoans his state! But the tor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ments
were real. By far more, however, they, through
this coarse agency of syllogistic dread, would act to show
man the degradation of his nature when all light of a
higher existence had disappeared. That which did not
exist for natures supposed capable originally of immortality,
how should it exist for him? And that man must
have observed with little attention what takes place in
this world if he needs to be told that nothing tends to
make his own species cheap and hateful in his eyes so
certainly as moral degradation driven to a point of no
hope. So in squalid dungeons, in captivities of slaves,
nay, in absolute pauperism, all hate each other fiercely.
Even with us, how sad is the thought&mdash;that, just as a
man needs pity, as he is stript of all things, when most
the sympathy of men should settle on him, then most
is he contemplated with a hard-hearted contempt! The
Jews when injured by our own oppressive princes were
despised and hated. Had they raised an empire, licked
their oppressors well, they would have been compassionately
loved. So lunatics heretofore; so galley-slaves&mdash;Toulon,
Marseilles, etc. This brutal principle of degradation
soon developed in man. The Gods, therefore, performed
a great agency for man. And it is clear that God
did not discourage <i>common</i> rites or rights for His altar or
theirs. Nay, he sent Israel to Egypt&mdash;as one reason&mdash;to
learn ceremonies amongst a people who sequestered them.
In evil the Jews always clove to their religion. Next the
difficulty of people, miracles, though less for false Gods,
and least of all for the meanest, was <i>alike</i> for both.
Astarte does not kill Sayth on the spot, but by a judgment.
Gods, no more their God, spake an instant law.
Even the prophets are properly no prophets, but only the
mode of speech by God,&mdash;as clear as He <i>can</i> speak. Men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
mistake God's hate by their own. So neither could He
reveal Himself. A vast age would be required for seeing
God.</p>

<p>But for the thought of man as evil (or of any other form
of evil), as reconcilable with their idea of a perfect God, a
happy idea may, like the categories, proceed upon a
necessity for a perfect <i>inversion</i> of the <i>methodus conspiciendi.</i>
Let us retrace, but in such a form as to be
apprehensible by all readers. Analytic and synthetic
propositions at once throw light upon the notion of a
category. Once it had been a mere abstraction; of no
possible use except as a convenient cell for referring (as
in a nest of boxes), which may perhaps as much degrade
the idea as a relative of my own degraded the image of
the crescent moon by saying, in his abhorrence of sentimentality,
that it reminded him of the segment from his
own thumb-nail when clean cut by an instrument called
a nail-cutter. This was the Aristotelian notion. But
Kant could not content himself with this idea. His
own theory (1) as to time and space, (2) the refutation of
Hume's notion of cause, and (3) his own great discovery
of synthetic and analytic propositions, all prepared the
way for a totally new view. But, now, what is the origin
of this necessity applied to the category as founded in
the synthesis? How does a synthesis make itself or anything
else necessary? Explain me that.</p>

<p>This was written perhaps a fortnight ago. Now,
Monday, May 23 (day fixed for Dan Good's execution),
I <i>do</i> explain it by what this moment I seem to have discovered&mdash;the
necessity of cause, of substance, etc., lies
in the intervening synthesis. This you <i>must</i> pass through
in the course tending to and finally reaching the idea; for
the analytical presupposes this synthesis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only must the energies of destruction be equal to
those of creation, but, in fact, perhaps by the trespassing
a little of the first upon the last, is the true advance sustained;
for it must be an advance as well as a balance.
But you say this will but in other words mean that forces
devoted (and properly so) to production or creation are
absorbed by destruction. True; but the opposing phenomena
will be going on in a large ratio, and each must
react on the other. The productive must meet and correspond
to the destructive. The destructive must revise
and stimulate the continued production.</p>

<h2><i>XXI. ON MIRACLES.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>What else is the laying of such a stress on miracles but
the case of 'a wicked and adulterous generation asking
a sign'?</p>

<p>But what are these miracles for? To prove a legislation
from God. But, first, this could not be proved, even
if miracle-working were the test of Divine mission, by
doing miracles until we knew whether the power were
genuine; <i>i.e.</i>, not, like the magicians of Pharaoh or the
witch of Endor, from below. Secondly, you are a poor,
pitiful creature, that think the power to do miracles, or
power of any kind that can exhibit itself in an act, the
note of a god-like commission. Better is one ray of
truth (not seen previously by man), of <i>moral</i> truth, <i>e.g.</i>,
forgiveness of enemies, than all the powers which could
create the world.</p>

<p>'Oh yes!' says the objector; 'but Christ was holy as a
man.' This we know first; then we judge by His power
that He must have been from God. But if it were
doubtful whether His power were from God, then, until
this doubt is <i>otherwise</i>, is independently removed, you
cannot decide if He <i>was</i> holy by a test of holiness absolutely
irrelevant. With other holiness&mdash;apparent holiness&mdash;a
simulation might be combined. You can never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
tell that a man is holy; and for the plain reason that
God only can read the heart.</p>

<p>'Let Him come down from the cross, and we,' etc.
Yes; they fancied so. But see what would really have
followed. They would have been stunned and confounded
for the moment, but not at all converted in
heart. Their hatred to Christ was not built on their unbelief,
but their unbelief in Christ was built on their
hatred; and this hatred would not have been mitigated
by another (however astounding) miracle. This I wrote
(Monday morning, June 7, 1847) in reference to my saying
on the general question of miracles: Why these
<i>dubious</i> miracles?&mdash;such as curing blindness that may
have been cured by a <i>process</i>?&mdash;since the <i>unity</i> given to
the act of healing is probably (more probably than otherwise)
but the figurative unity of the tendency to <i>mythus</i>;
or else it is that unity misapprehended and mistranslated
by the reporters. Such, again, as the miracles of the
loaves&mdash;so liable to be utterly gossip, so incapable of
being watched or examined amongst a crowd of 7,000
people. Besides, were these people mad? The very
fact which is said to have drawn Christ's pity, viz., their
situation in the desert, surely could not have escaped
their own attention on going thither. Think of 7,000
people rushing to a sort of destruction; for if less than
that the mere inconvenience was not worthy of Divine
attention. Now, said I, why not give us (if miracles <i>are</i>
required) one that nobody could doubt&mdash;removing a
mountain, <i>e.g.</i>? Yes; but here the other party begin to
<i>see</i> the evil of miracles. Oh, this would have <i>coerced</i>
people into believing! Rest you safe as to that. It
would have been no believing in any proper sense: it
would, at the utmost&mdash;and supposing no vital demur to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
popular miracle&mdash;have led people into that belief which
Christ Himself describes (and regrets) as calling Him
Lord! Lord! The pretended belief would have left
them just where they were as to any real belief in Christ.
Previously, however, or over and above all this, there
would be the demur (let the miracle have been what it
might) of, By what power, by whose agency or help?
For if Christ does a miracle, probably He may do it by
alliance with some <i>Z</i> standing behind, out of sight. Or
if by His own skill, how or whence derived, or of what
nature? This obstinately recurrent question remains.</p>

<p>There is not the meanest court in Christendom or Islam
that would not say, if called on to adjudicate the rights
of an estate on such evidence as the mere facts of the
Gospel: 'O good God, how can we do this? Which
of us knows who this Matthew was&mdash;whether he ever
lived, or, if so, whether he ever wrote a line of all this?
or, if he did, how situated as to motives, as to means of
information, as to judgment and discrimination? Who
knows anything of the contrivances or the various personal
interests in which the whole narrative originated,
or when? All is dark and dusty.' Nothing in such a
case <i>can</i> be proved but what shines by its own light.
Nay, God Himself could not attest a miracle, but (listen
to this!)&mdash;but by the internal revelation or visiting of
the Spirit&mdash;to evade which, to dispense with which, a
miracle is ever resorted to.</p>

<p>Besides the objection to miracles that they are not
capable of attestation, Hume's objection is not that they
are false, but that they are incommunicable. Two
different duties arise for the man who witnesses a miracle
and for him who receives traditionally. The duty of the
first is to confide in his own experience, which may,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
besides, have been repeated; of the second, to confide in
his understanding, which says: 'Less marvel that the
reporter should have erred than that nature should have
been violated.'</p>

<p>How dearly do these people betray their own hypocrisy
about the divinity of Christianity, and at the same time
the meanness of their own natures, who think the
Messiah, or God's Messenger, must first prove His own
commission by an act of power; whereas (1) a new
revelation of moral forces could not be invented by all
generations, and (2) an act of power much more probably
argues an alliance with the devil. I should gloomily
suspect a man who came forward as a magician.</p>

<p>Suppose the Gospels written thirty years after the
events, and by ignorant, superstitious men who have
adopted the fables that old women had surrounded
Christ with&mdash;how does this supposition vitiate the report
of Christ's parables? But, on the other hand, they
could no more have invented the parables than a man
alleging a diamond-mine could invent a diamond as attestation.
The parables prove themselves.</p>

<h2><i>XXII. 'LET HIM COME DOWN FROM THE
CROSS.'</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Now, this is exceedingly well worth consideration. I
know not at all whether what I am going to say has
been said already&mdash;life would not suffice in every field or
section of a field to search every nook and section of a
nook for the possibilities of chance utterance given to
any stray opinion. But this I know without any doubt at
all, that it cannot have been said effectually, cannot have
been so said as to publish and disperse itself; else it is
impossible that the crazy logic current upon these topics
should have lived, or that many separate arguments
should ever for very shame have been uttered. Said or
not said, let us presume it unsaid, and let me state the
true answer as if <i>de novo</i>, even if by accident somewhere
the darkness shelters this same answer as uttered long
ago.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, I will suppose that He <i>had</i> come
down from the Cross. No case can so powerfully illustrate
the filthy falsehood and pollution of that idea which
men generally entertain, which the sole creditable books
universally build upon. What would have followed?
This would have followed: that, inverting the order of
every true emanation from God, instead of growing and
expanding for ever like a <big>&#60;</big>, it would have attained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
its <i>maximum</i> at the first. The effect for the half-hour
would have been prodigious, and from that moment
when it began to flag it would degrade rapidly, until, in
three days, a far fiercer hatred against Christ would
have been moulded. For observe: into what state of
mind would this marvel have been received? Into any
good-will towards Christ, which previously had been defeated
by the belief that He was an impostor in the
sense that He pretended to a power of miracles which
in fact He had not? By no means. The sense in which
Christ had been an impostor for them was in assuming a
commission, a spiritual embassy with appropriate functions,
promises, prospects, to which He had no title.
How had that notion&mdash;not, viz., of miraculous impostorship,
but of spiritual impostorship&mdash;been able to maintain
itself? Why, what should have reasonably destroyed
the notion? This, viz., the sublimity of His
moral system. But does the reader imagine that this
sublimity is of a nature to be seen intellectually&mdash;that
is, insulated and <i>in vacuo</i> for the intellect? No more
than by geometry or by a <i>sorites</i> any man constitutionally
imperfect could come to understand the nature of the
sexual appetite; or a man born deaf could make representable
to himself the living truth of music, a man
born blind could make representable the living truth of
colours. All men are not equally deaf in heart&mdash;far from
it&mdash;the differences are infinite, and some men never could
comprehend the beauty of spiritual truth. But no man
could comprehend it without preparation. That preparation
was found in his training of Judaism; which to those
whose hearts were hearts of flesh, not stony and charmed
against hearing, had already anticipated the first outlines
of Christian ideas. Sin, purity, holiness unimaginable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
these had already been inoculated into the Jewish mind.
And amongst the race inoculated Christ found enough for
a central nucleus to His future Church. But the natural
tendency under the fever-mist of strife and passion,
evoked by the present position in the world operating
upon robust, full-blooded life, unshaken by grief or tenderness
of nature, or constitutional sadness, is to fail
altogether of seeing the features which so powerfully
mark Christianity. Those features, instead of coming
out into strong relief, resemble what we see in mountainous
regions where the mist covers the loftiest peaks.</p>

<p>We have heard of a man saying: 'Give me such titles
of honour, so many myriads of pounds, and then I will
consider your proposal that I should turn Christian.'
Now, survey&mdash;pause for one moment to survey&mdash;the
immeasurable effrontery of this speech. First, it replies
to a proposal having what object&mdash;our happiness or his?
Why, of course, his: how are we interested, except on a
sublime principle of benevolence, in his faith being right?
Secondly, it is a reply presuming money, the most fleshly
of objects, to modify or any way control religion, <i>i.e.</i>, a
spiritual concern. This in itself is already monstrous,
and pretty much the same as it would be to order a
charge of bayonets against gravitation, or against an
avalanche, or against an earthquake, or against a deluge.
But, suppose it were <i>not</i> so, what incomprehensible
reasoning justifies the notion that not we are to be paid,

<h2><i>XXIII. IS THE HUMAN RACE ON THE DOWN GRADE?</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>As to individual nations, it is matter of notoriety that
they are often improgressive. As a whole, it may be
true that the human race is under a necessity of slowly
advancing; and it may be a necessity, also, that the
current of the moving waters should finally absorb into
its motion that part of the waters which, left to itself,
would stagnate. All this may be true&mdash;and yet it will
not follow that the human race must be moving constantly
upon an ascending line, as thus:</p>

<center><pre>
        B
       /
      /
     /
    /
   /
  /
 A
</pre></center>

<p>nor even upon such a line, with continual pauses or rests
interposed, as thus:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><img src="images/p196a.jpg" width="300" height="158" alt="p196a" title="" /></div>

<p>where there is no going back, though a constant interruption
to the going forward; but a third hypothesis is
possible: there may be continual loss of ground, yet so
that continually the loss is more than compensated, and
the total result, for any considerable period of observation,
may be that progress is maintained:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><img src="images/p196b.jpg" width="300" height="159" alt="p196b" title="" /></div>

<p>At O, by comparison with the previous elevation at A,
there is a repeated falling back; but still upon the whole,
and pursuing the inquiry through a sufficiently large
segment of time, the constant report is&mdash;ascent.</p>

<p>Upon this explanation it is perfectly consistent with a
general belief in the going forward of man&mdash;that this particular
age in which we live might be stationary, or might
even have gone back. It cannot, therefore, be upon any
<i>&agrave; priori</i> principle that I maintain the superiority of this
age. It is, and must be upon special examination,
applied to the phenomena of this special age. The last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
century, in its first thirty years, offered the spectacle of a
death-like collapse in the national energies. All great
interests suffered together. The intellectual power of the
country, spite of the brilliant display in a lower element,
made by one or two men of genius, languished as a whole.
The religious feeling was torpid, and in a degree which
insured the strong reaction of some irritating galvanism,
or quickening impulse such as that which was in fact
supplied by Methodism. It is not with that age that I
wish to compare the present. I compare it with the age
which terminated thirty years ago&mdash;roused, invigorated,
searched as that age was through all its sensibilities by
the electric shock of the French Revolution. It is by
comparison with an age so keenly alive, penetrated by
ideas stirring and uprooting, that I would compare it;
and even then the balance of gain in well-calculated
resource, fixed yet stimulating ideals, I hold to be in our
favour&mdash;and this in opposition to much argument in an
adverse spirit from many and influential quarters. Indeed,
it is a remark which more than once I have been
led to make in print: that if a foreigner were to inquire
for the moral philosophy, the ethics, and even for the
metaphysics, of our English literature, the answer would
be, 'Look for them in the great body of our Divinity.'
Not merely the more scholastic works on theology, but
the occasional sermons of our English divines contain a
body of richer philosophical speculation than is elsewhere
to be found; and, to say the truth, far more instructive
than anything in our Lockes, Berkeleys, or other express
and professional philosophers. Having said this by way
of showing that I do not overlook their just pretensions,
let me have leave to notice a foible in these writers which
is not merely somewhat ludicrous, but even seriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
injurious to truth. One and all, through a long series of
two hundred and fifty years, think themselves called upon
to tax their countrymen&mdash;each severally in his own age&mdash;with
a separate, peculiar, and unexampled guilt of infidelity
and irreligion. Each worthy man, in his turn,
sees in his own age overt signs of these offences not to be
matched in any other. Five-and-twenty periods of ten
years each may be taken, concerning each of which some
excellent writer may be cited to prove that it had reached
a maximum of atrocity, such as should not easily have
been susceptible of aggravation, but which invariably the
<i>relays</i> through all the subsequent periods affirm their
own contemporaries to have attained. Every decennium
is regularly worse than that which precedes it, until the
mind is perfectly confounded by the <i>Pelion upon Ossa</i>
which must overwhelm the last term of the twenty-five.
It is the mere necessity of a logical <i>sorites</i>, that such a
horrible race of villains as the men of the twenty-fifth
decennium ought not to be suffered to breathe. Now, the
whole error arises out of an imbecile self-surrender to the
first impressions from the process of abstraction as
applied to remote objects. Survey a town under the
benefit of a ten miles' distance, combined with a dreamy
sunshine, and it will appear a city of celestial palaces.
Enter it, and you will find the same filth, the same ruins,
the same disproportions as anywhere else. So of past
ages, seen through the haze of an abstraction which
removes all circumstantial features of deformity. Call
up any one of those ages, if it were possible, into the
realities of life, and these worthy praisers of the past
would be surprised to find every feature repeated which
they had fancied peculiar to their own times. Meanwhile
this erroneous doctrine of sermons has a double ill con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>sequence:
first, the whole chain of twenty-five writers,
when brought together, consecutively reflect a colouring
of absurdity upon each other; separately they might be
endurable, but all at once, predicating (each of his own
period exclusively) what runs with a rolling fire through
twenty-five such periods in succession, cannot but recall
to the reader that senseless doctrine of a physical decay
in man, as if man were once stronger, broader, taller, etc.&mdash;upon
which hypothesis of a gradual descent why
should it have stopped at any special point? How could
the human race have failed long ago to reach the point
of <i>zero</i>? But, secondly, such a doctrine is most injurious
and insulting to Christianity. If, after eighteen hundred
years of development, it could be seriously true of Christianity
that it had left any age or generation of men
worse in conduct, or in feeling, or in belief, than all their
predecessors, what reasonable expectation could we have
that in eighteen hundred years more the case would be
better? Such thoughtless opinions make Christianity to
be a failure.</p>

<h2><i>XXIV. BREVIA: SHORT ESSAYS (IN CONNECTION<br />
WITH EACH OTHER.</i>)</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<h3>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paganism and Christianity&mdash;the Ideas of Duty
and Holiness.</span></h3>

<p>The Pagan God could have perfect peace with his votary,
and yet could have no tendency to draw that votary to
himself. Not so with the God of Christianity, who cannot
give His peace without drawing like a vortex to Himself,
who cannot draw into His own vortex without
finding His peace fulfilled.</p>

<p>'An age when lustre too intense.'&mdash;I am much mistaken
if Mr. Wordsworth is not deeply wrong here.
Wrong he is beyond a doubt as to the <i>fact</i>; for there
could have been no virtual intensity of lustre (unless
merely as a tinsel toy) when it was contradicted by
everything in the <i>manners</i>, <i>habits</i>, and situations of the
Pagan Gods&mdash;they who were content to play in the
coarsest manner the part of gay young bloods, <i>sowing</i>
their wild oats, and with a recklessness of consequences
to their female partners never by possibility rivalled by
men. I believe and affirm that lustre the most dazzling
and blinding would not have any <i>ennobling</i> effect except as
received into a matrix of previous unearthly and holy
type.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p>As to Bacchus being eternally young, the ancients had
no idea or power to frame the idea of eternity. Their
eternity was a limitary thing. And this I say not empirically,
but <i>&agrave; priori</i>, on the ground that without the
idea of holiness and unfleshliness, eternity cannot rise
buoyant from the ground, cannot sustain itself. But
waive this, and what becomes of the other things? If
he were characteristically distinguished as young, then,
by a mere rebound of the logic, the others were not so
honoured, else where is the special privilege of Bacchus?</p>

<br />
<p>'And she shall sing there as in the days of her youth'
(Hosea ii. 15).&mdash;The case of pathos, a person coming
back to places, recalling the days of youth after a long
woe, is quite unknown to the ancients&mdash;nay, the
maternal affection itself, though used inevitably, is never
consciously reviewed as an object of beauty.</p>

<br />
<p>Duties arise everywhere, but&mdash;do not mistake&mdash;not
under their sublime form <i>as</i> duties. I claim the honour
to have first exposed a fallacy too common: duties never
did, never will, arise save under Christianity, since without
it the sense of a morality lightened by religious
motive, aspiring to holiness, not only of act, but of motive,
had not before it even arisen. It is the pressure of
society, its mere needs and palpable claims, which first
calls forth duties, but not <i>as</i> duties; rather as the casting
of parts in a scenical arrangement. A duty, under the
low conception to which at first it conforms, is a <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, no
more; it is strictly what we mean when we talk of a
<i>part.</i> The sense of conscience strictly is not touched
under any preceding system of religion. It is the
daughter of Christianity. How little did Wordsworth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
seize the fact in his Ode: 'Stern Daughter of the Voice
of God' is not enough; the voice of God is the conscience;
and neither has been developed except by Christianity.</p>

<br />
<p>The conscience of a pagan was a conscience pointing
to detection: it pointed only to the needs of society, and
caused fear, shame, anxiety, only on the principles of
sympathy; that is, from the impossibility of releasing
himself from a dependence on the reciprocal feelings&mdash;the
rebound, the dependence on the <i>re</i>sentments of
others.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Morals.</i>&mdash;Even ordinary morals could have little practical
weight with the ancients: witness the Roman juries
and Roman trials. Had there been any sense of justice
predominant, could Cicero have hoped to prevail by such
defences as that of Milo and fifty-six others, where the
argument is merely fanciful&mdash;such a <i>Hein-gespinst</i> as
might be applauded with 'very good!' 'bravo!' in any
mock trial like that silly one devised by Dean Swift.</p>

<br />
<p>The slowness and obtuseness of the Romans to pathos
appears <i>&agrave; priori</i> in their amphitheatre, and its tendency
to put out the theatre; secondly, <i>&agrave; posteriori</i>, in the fact
that their theatre was put out; and also, <i>&agrave; posteriori</i>, in
the coarseness of their sensibilities to real distresses unless
costumed and made sensible as well as intelligible.
The grossness of this demand, which proceeded even so
far as pinching to elicit a cry, is beyond easy credit to
men of their time.</p>

<br />
<p>The narrow range of the Greek intellect, always revolving
through seven or eight centuries about a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
memorable examples&mdash;from the Life of Themistocles to
Zeno or Demosthenes.</p>

<br />
<p>The Grecian glories of every kind seem sociable and
affable, courting sympathy. The Jewish seem malignantly
<ins class="mycorr" title="autarkeis">&#945;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#962;</ins>.</p>

<br />
<p>But just as Paganism respected only rights of action,
possession, etc., Christianity respects a far higher scale
of claims, viz., as to the wounds to feelings, to deep
injury, though not grounded in anything measurable or
expoundable by external results. Man! you have said
that which you were too proud and obstinate to unsay,
which has lacerated some heart for thirty years that had
perhaps secretly and faithfully served you and yours.
Christianity lays hold on that as a point of conscience,
if not of honour, to make <i>amends</i>, if in no other way, by
remorse.</p>

<br />
<p>As to the tears of &#338;dipus in the crises. I am compelled
to believe that Sophocles erred as regarded nature;
for in cases so transcendent as this Greek nature and
English nature could not differ. In the great agony on
Mount &#338;ta, Hercules points the pity of his son Hyllus
to the extremity of torment besieging him on the humiliating
evidence of the tears which they extorted from
him. 'Pity me,' says he, 'that weep with sobs like a girl:
a thing that no one could have charged upon the man'
(pointing to himself); 'but ever without a groan I followed
out to the end my calamities.' Now, on the contrary,
on the words of the oracle, that beckoned away with
impatient sounds &#338;dipus from his dear sublime Antigone,
&#338;dipus is made to weep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is impossible. Always the tears arose, and
will arise, on the <i>relaxation</i> of the torment and in the
rear of silent anguish on its sudden suspense, amidst a
continued headlong movement; and also, in looking
back, tears, unless checked, might easily arise. But
never during the torment: on the rack there are no tears
shed, and those who suffered on the scaffold never yet
shed tears, unless it may have been at some oblique glance
at things collateral to their suffering, as suppose a sudden
glimpse of a child's face which they had loved in life.</p>

<br />
<p>Is not every <ins class="mycorr" title="aiôn">&#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;</ins> of civilization an inheritance from a
previous state not so high? Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the Romans, with
so little of Christian restraint, would have perished by
reaction of their own vices, but for certain prejudices
and follies about trade, manufacture, etc., and but for
oil on their persons to prevent contagion. Now, this
oil had been, I think, a secret bequeathed from some
older and higher civilization long since passed away.
We have it not, but neither have we so much needed it.
Soon, however, we shall restore the secret by science
more perfect.</p>

<br />
<p>Was Christianity meant to narrow or to widen the
road to future happiness? If I were translated to some
other planet, I should say:</p>

<p>1. <i>No</i>; for it raised a far higher standard&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, made
the realization of this far more difficult.</p>

<p>2. <i>Yes</i>; for it introduced a new machinery for realizing
this standard: (first) Christ's atonement, (second)
grace.</p>

<br />
<p>But, according to some bigots (as Jeremy Taylor and
Sir Thomas Browne), as cited by Coleridge, Christianity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
first opened any road at all. Yet, surely they forget
that, if simply to come too early was the fatal bar to
their claims in the case, Abraham, the father of the
faithful, could not benefit.</p>

<br />
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, October 21 (1843), I think, or
the day before, I first perceived that the first great proof
of Christianity is the proof of Judaism, and the proof of
that lies in the Jehovah. What merely natural man
capable of devising a God for himself such as the
Jewish?</p>

<br />
<p>Of all eradications of this doctrine (of human progress),
the most difficult is that connected with the outward
shows&mdash;in air, in colouring, in form, in grouping
of the great elements composing the furniture of the
heavens and the earth. It is most difficult, even when
confining one's attention to the modern case, and neglecting
the comparison with the ancient, at all to assign
the analysis of those steps by which to us Christians
(but never before) the sea and the sky and the clouds
and the many inter-modifications of these, A, B, C, D, and
again the many interactions of the whole, the sun (S.),
the moon (M.), the noon (N. S.)&mdash;the breathless, silent
noon&mdash;the gay afternoon&mdash;the solemn glory of sunset&mdash;the
dove-like glimpse of Paradise in the tender light of
early dawn&mdash;by which these obtain a power utterly unknown,
undreamed of, unintelligible to a Pagan. If we
had spoken to Plato&mdash;to Cicero&mdash;of the deep pathos in a
sunset, would he&mdash;would either&mdash;have gone along with
us? The foolish reader thinks, Why, perhaps not, not
altogether as to the quantity&mdash;the degree of emotion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Doubtless, it is undeniable that we moderns have far
more sensibility to the phenomena and visual glories of
this world which we inhabit. And it <i>is</i> possible that, reflecting
on the singularity of this characteristic badge
worn by modern civilization, he may go so far as to
suspect that Christianity has had something to do with
it. But, on seeking to complete the chain which connects
them, he finds himself quite unable to recover the
principal link.</p>

<p>Now, it will prove, after all, even for myself who have
exposed and revealed these new ligatures by which
Christianity connects man with awful interests in the
world, a most insurmountable task to assign the total
nidus in which this new power resides, or the total
phenomenology through which that passes to and fro.
Generally it seems to stand thus: God reveals Himself to
us more or less dimly in vast numbers of processes; for
example, in those of vegetation, animal growth, crystallization,
etc. These impress us not primarily, but
secondarily on reflection, after considering the enormity
of changes worked annually, and working even at the
moment we speak. Then, again, other arrangements
throw us more powerfully upon the moral qualities of
God; <i>e.g.</i>, we see the fence, the shell, the covering,
varied in ten million ways, by which in buds and
blossoms He insures the ultimate protection of the fruit.
What protection, analogous to this, has He established
for animals; or, taking up the question in the ideal
case, for man, the supreme of His creatures? We perceive
that He has relied upon love, upon love strengthened
to the adamantine force of insanity or delirium, by the
mere aspect of utter, utter helplessness in the human
infant. It is not by power, by means visibly developed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
that this result is secured, but by means spiritual and
'transcendental' in the highest degree.</p>

<br />
<p>The baseness and incorrigible ignobility of the Oriental
mind is seen in the radical inability to appreciate justice
when brought into collision with the royal privileges of
rulers that represent the nation. Not only, for example,
do Turks, etc., think it an essential function of royalty
to cut off heads, but they think it essential to the consummation
of this function that the sacrifice should rest
upon caprice known and avowed. To suppose it wicked
as a mere process of executing the laws would rob it of
all its grandeur. It would stand for nothing. Nay,
even if the power were conceded, and the sovereign
should abstain from using it of his own free will and
choice, this would not satisfy the wretched Turk.
Blood, lawless blood&mdash;a horrid Moloch, surmounting a
grim company of torturers and executioners, and on the
other side revelling in a thousand unconsenting women&mdash;this
hideous image of brutal power and unvarnished lust
is clearly indispensable to the Turk as incarnating the
representative grandeur of his nation. With this ideal
ever present to the Asiatic and Mohammedan mind, no
wonder that even their religion needs the aid of the
sword and bloodshed to secure conversion.</p>

<br />
<p>In the <i>Spectator</i> is mentioned, as an Eastern apologue,
that a vizier who (like Chaucer's Canace) had learned
the language of birds used it with political effect to his
sovereign. The sultan had demanded to know what a
certain reverend owl was speechifying about to another
owl distantly related to him. The vizier listened, and
reported that the liberal old owl was making a settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>ment
upon his daughter, in case his friend's son should
marry her, of a dozen ruined villages. Loyally long
life to our noble sultan! I shall, my dear friend, always
have a ruined village at your service against a rainy day,
so long as our present ruler reigns and desolates.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Obliviscor jam injurias tuas, Clodia.</i>&mdash;This is about the
most barefaced use of the rhetorical trick&mdash;viz., to affect
<i>not</i> to do, to pass over whilst actually doing all the while&mdash;that
anywhere I have met with.&mdash;'Pro C&aelig;lio,' p. 234
[p. 35, Volgraff's edition].</p>

<br />
<p><i>Evaserint</i> and <i>comprehenderint.</i>&mdash;Suppose they had
rushed out, and suppose they had seized Licinus. So I
read&mdash;not <i>issent.</i>&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 236</i> [<i>Ibid., p. 44</i>].</p>

<br />
<p><i>Velim vel potius quid nolim dicere.</i>&mdash;Aristotle's case of
throwing overboard your own property. He <i>vult dicere</i>,
else he could not mean, yet <i>nonvult</i>, for he is shocked at
saying such things of Clodia.&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 242</i> [<i>Ibid., p. 49</i>].<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>


<h3>2.&mdash;MORAL AND PRACTICAL.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<p><i>Morality.</i>&mdash;That Paley's principle does not apply to
the higher morality of Christianity is evident from this:
when I seek to bring before myself some ordinary form
of wickedness that all men offend by, I think, perhaps,
of their ingratitude. The man born to &pound;400 a year
thinks nothing of it, compares himself only with those
above his own standard, and sees rather a ground of discontent
in his &pound;400 as not being &pound;4,000 than any ground
of deep thankfulness. Now, this being so odious a form
of immorality, should&mdash;by Paley&mdash;terminate in excessive
evil. On the contrary, it is the principle, the very dissatisfaction
which God uses for keep<i>ing</i> the world mov<i>ing</i>
(how villainous the form&mdash;these 'ings'!).</p>

<br />
<p>All faith in the great majority is, and ought to be,
implicit. That is, your faith is not unrolled&mdash;not separately
applied to each individual doctrine&mdash;but is applied
to some individual man, and on him you rely. What he
says, you say; what he believes, you believe. Now, he
believes all these doctrines, and you implicitly through
him. But what I chiefly say as the object of this note
is, that the bulk of men must believe by an implicit
faith. <i>Ergo</i>, decry it not.</p>

<br />
<p>You delude yourself, Christian theorist, with the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of offences that else would unfit you for heaven being
washed out by repentance. But hearken a moment.
Figure the case of those innumerable people that, having
no temptation, small or great, to commit murder, <i>would</i>
have committed it cheerfully for half-a-crown; that,
having no opening or possibility for committing adultery,
<i>would</i> have committed it in case they had. Now, of these
people, having no possibility of repentance (for how
repent of what they have not done?), and yet ripe to
excess for the guilt, what will you say? Shall they
perish because they <i>might</i> have been guilty? Shall they
not perish because the potential guilt was not, by pure
accident, accomplished <i>in esse</i>?</p>

<br />
<p>Here is a mistake to be guarded against. If you ask
why such a man, though by nature gross or even Swift-like
in his love of dirty ideas, yet, because a gentleman
and moving in corresponding society, does not indulge
in such brutalities, the answer is that he abstains through
the modifications of the sympathies. A low man in low
society would not be doubtful of its reception; but he,
by the anticipations of sympathy (a form that should be
introduced as technically as Kant's anticipations of perception),
feels it would be ill or gloomily received. Well
now, I, when saying that a man is altered by sympathy
so as to think <i>that</i>, through means of this power, which
otherwise he would not think, shall be interpreted of
such a case as that above. But wait; there is a distinction:
the man does not think differently, he only
acts as if he thought differently. The case I contemplate
is far otherwise; it is where a man feels a lively contempt
or admiration in consequence of seeing or hearing
such feelings powerfully expressed by a multitude, or, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
least, by others which else he would not have felt.
Vulgar people would sit for hours in the presence of
people the most refined, totally unaware of their superiority,
for the same reason that most people (if assenting
to the praise of the Lord's Prayer) would do so hyper-critically,
because its real and chief beauties are negative.</p>

<br />
<p>Not only is it false that my understanding is no
measure or rule for another man, but of necessity it is
so, and every step I take towards truth for myself is a
step made on behalf of every other man.</p>

<br />
<p>We doubt if the world in the sense of a synthesis
of action&mdash;the procession and carrying out of ends and
purposes&mdash;<i>could</i> consist with the <ins class="mycorr" title="anti">&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;</ins>-world (in a religious
sense). Men who divide all into pious people and next
to devils see in such a state of evil the natural tendency
(as in all other <i>monstrous</i> evils&mdash;which this must be if an
evil at all) to correction and redress. But now assume
a man, sober, honourable, cheerful, healthy, active,
occupied all day long in toilsome duties (or what he
believes duties) for ends not selfish; this man has never
had a thought of death, hell, etc., and looking abroad on
those who dwell in such contemplations, he regards them
sincerely, not unkindly or with contempt; partially he
respects them, but he looks on them as under a monstrous
delusion, in a fever, in a panic, as in a case of broken
equilibrium. Now he is right. And, moreover, secondly,
two other feelings or suspicions come on, (1) of hypocrisy,
(2) of the violation of inner shame in publishing the most
awful private feelings.</p>

<p><i>The Tendency of a Good Fortune inherited.</i>&mdash;I know not
that any man has reason to wish a <i>sufficient</i> patrimonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
estate for his son. Much to have something so as to
start with an advantage. But the natural consequence
of having a full fortune is to become idle and vapid.
For, on asking what a young man has that he can employ
himself upon, the answer would be, 'Oh! why, those
pursuits which presuppose solitude.' At once you feel
this to be hollow nonsense. Not one man in ten
thousand has powers to turn solitude into a blessing.
They care not, <i>e.g.</i>, for geometry; and the cause is chiefly
that they have been ill taught in geometry; and the
effect is that geometry must and will languish, if treated
as a mere amateur pursuit. So of any other. Secondly,
yet of Englishmen I must say that beyond all nations a
man so situated does not, in fact, become idle. He it is,
and his class, that discharge the public business of each
county or district. Thirdly: And in the view, were
there no other, one sees at once the use of fox-hunting,
let it be as boisterous as you please. Is it not better to
be boisterous than gossip-ridden, eaves-dropping, seeking
aliment for the spirits in the petty scandal of the neighbourhood?</p>

<p>'He' (<i>The Times</i>) 'declares that the poorest artisan
has a greater stake than they' ('the Landed Interest')
'in the prosperity of the country, and is, consequently,
more likely to give sound advice. His exposition of the
intimate connection existing between the welfare of the
poor workman and the welfare of the country is both
just and admirable. But he manifestly underrates the
corresponding relations of the landowners, and wholly
omits to show, even if the artisan's state were the
greatest, how his opinions are likely to be most valuable.
To suppose that a man is necessarily the best judge in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
whatever concerns him most is a sad <i>non-sequitur</i>; for if
self-interest ensured wisdom, no one would ever go wrong
in anything. Every man would be his own minister,
and every invalid would be his own best physician.
The wounded limbs of the community are the best
judges of the pain they suffer; but it is the wise heads
of the community that best can apply a remedy that
best can cure the wound without causing it to break out
in another quarter. Poverty is blind; but the upper
classes "education has enlightened, and habit made
foreseeing."'</p>

<p>We live in times great from the events and little from
the character of the actors. Every month summons us
to the spectacle of some new perfidy in the leaders of
parties and the most conspicuous public servants; and
the profligacy which we charge upon the statesmen of
the seventeenth century has revolved in full measure
upon our own days.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Justifications of Novels.</i>&mdash;The two following justifications
of novels occur to me. Firstly, that if some
dreadful crisis awaited a ship of passengers at the line&mdash;where
equally the danger was mysterious and multiform,
the safety mysterious and multiform&mdash;how monstrous if
a man should say to a lady, 'What are you reading?'
'Oh, I'm reading about our dreadful crisis, now so near';
and he should answer, 'Oh, nonsense! read something
to improve your mind; read about Alexander the Great,
about Spurius Ahala, about Caius Gracchus, or, if you
please, Tiberius.' But just such nonsense it is, when
people ridicule reading romances in which the great event
of the fiction is the real great event of a female life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>There are others, you say&mdash;she loses a child. Yes,
that's a great event. But that arises out of this vast
equinoctial event.</p>

<p>Secondly, as all things are predisposed to the natures
which must be surrounded by them, so we may see that
the element of social evolution of character, manners,
caprices, etc., has been adapted to the vast mass of
human minds. It is a mean element, you say. The revelations
of Albert Smith, Dickens, etc., are essentially
mean, vulgar, plebeian, not only in an aristocratic sense,
but also in a philosophical sense. True, but the minds
that are to live and move in it are also mean, essentially
mean. Nothing grand in them? Yes, doubtless in the
veriest grub as to capacity, but the capacity is undeveloped.</p>

<p><i>Ergo</i>, as to the intrigue or fable, and as to the conduct
or evolution of this fable&mdash;novels must be the chief
natural resource of woman.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Moral Certainty.</i>&mdash;As that a child of two years (or
under) is not party to a plot. Now, this would allow a
shade of doubt&mdash;a child so old might cry out or give
notice.</p>

<br />
<p>This monstrous representation that the great war with
France (1803-15) had for its object to prevent Napoleon
from sitting on the throne of France&mdash;which recently, in
contempt of all truth and common-sense, I have so repeatedly
seen advanced&mdash;throws a man profoundly on the
question of what <i>was</i> the object of that war. Surely, in
so far as we are concerned, the matter was settled at
Amiens in the very first year of the century. December,
1799, Napoleon had been suffered by the unsteady public
opinion of France&mdash;abhorring a master, and yet sensible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that for the chief conscious necessity of France, viz., a
developer of her latent martial powers, she must look for
a master or else have her powers squandered&mdash;to mount
the consular throne. He lived, he <i>could</i> live, only by
victorious war. Most perilous was the prospect for
England. In the path which not Napoleon, but France,
was now preparing to tread, and which was the path of
Napoleon no otherwise than that he was the tool of
France, was that servitor who must gratify her grand
infirmity or else be rapidly extinguished himself, unhappily
for herself, England was the main counter-champion.
The course of honour left to England was
too fatally the course of resistance. Resistance to what?
To Napoleon personally? Not at all; but to Napoleon
as pledged by his destiny to the prosecution of a French
conquering policy. That personally England had no
hostility to Napoleon is settled by the fact that she had
at Amiens cheerfully conceded the superior power.
Under what title? would have been the most childish of
demurs. That by act she never conceded the title of
emperor was the mere natural diplomatic result of never
having once been at peace with Napoleon under that title.
Else it was a point of entire indifference. Granting the
consulship, she had granted all that could be asked. And
what she opposed was the determined war course of
Napoleon and the schemes of ultra-Polish partition to
which Napoleon had privately tempted her under circumstances
of no such sense as existed and still exist for
Russia. This policy, as soon as exposed, and not before
bitter insults to herself, England resisted. And therefore
it is that at this day we live. But as to Napoleon, as
apart from the policy of Napoleon, no childishness can
be wilder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p>At some unlucky moment when the Crown commanded
unusual resources, the De Quinceys met with the fate
ascribed, perhaps fabulously, to some small heavenly
bodies (asteroids or what, I do not precisely know): on
some dark day, by mistake perhaps, they exploded, and
scattered their ruins all over the central provinces of
England, where chiefly had lain their territorial influence.
Especially in the counties of Leicester, Lincoln and
Rutland were found fragments of the vast landed estates
held by these potentates when Earls of Winchester.</p>

<br />
<p>The hatred of truth at first dawning&mdash;that instinct
which makes you revolt from the pure beams which
search the foul depths and abysses of error&mdash;is well illustrated
by the action of the atmospheric currents, when
blowing through an open window upon smoke. What do
you see? Sometimes the impression is strong upon your
<i>ocular</i> belief that the window is driving the smoke in.
You can hardly be convinced of the contrary&mdash;scarcely
when five or seven minutes has absolutely rarefied the
smoke so much that a book-lettering previously invisible
has become even legible. And at last, when the fact, the
result, the experience, has corrected the contradictory
theory of the eye, you begin to suspect, without any aid
from science, that there were two currents, one of which
comes round in a curve <big>&#9789;</big> and effects the exit for the
other which the window had driven in; just as in the
Straits of Gibraltar there is manifestly an upper current
setting one way, which you therefore conjecture to argue
a lower current setting the other, and thus redressing the
equilibrium. Here the smoke corresponds to bits of chip
or any loose suspended body in the Gibraltar current.
What answers to the current of water is the air, and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the equilibrium <i>is</i> kept up, the re-entrant current balances
your retiring current, and the latter carries out the smoke
entangled in itself. By the objection, say, of a child,
there ought to be a re-entrant column of smoke, which
there is not. For the air drives the smoke of the fire up
the chimney, and of its own contribution the air has no
smoke to give.</p>

<p>Or the Augean stable may image it. Doubtless when
the first disturbance took place in the abominable mess,
those acting would be apt to question for a moment
whether it had not been more advisable to leave it
alone.</p>

<br />
<p>Moralists say, 'Nobody will attack you, or hate you,
or blame you for your virtues.' What falsehood! Not
<i>as</i> virtues, it may be in their eyes, but virtues, nevertheless.
Connect with Kant the error of supposing <i>&aelig;tas
parentum</i>, etc., to be the doctrine of sin.</p>

<br />
<p>Not for what you have done, but for what you are&mdash;not
because in life you did forsake a wife and children&mdash;did
endure to eat and drink and lie softly yourself whilst
those who should have been as your heart-drops were
starving: not because you did that so much is forgiven
you, but because you were capable of that, therefore you
are incapable of heaven.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Immodesty.</i>&mdash;The greatest mistake occurs to me now
(Wednesday, April 17th, '44). A girl who should have
been unhappily conscious of voluptuous hours, her you
would call modest in case of her passing with downcast
looks. But why, then, is she not so? That girl is im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>modest
who reconciles to herself such things, and yet
assumes the look of innocence.</p>

<br />
<p><i>About Women.</i>&mdash;A man brings his own idle preconceptions,
and fancies that he has learned them from
his experience.</p>

<br />
<p>Far more to be feared than any depth of serious love,
however absorbing and apparently foolish, is that vicious
condition in which trifling takes the place of all serious
love, when women are viewed only as dolls, and
addressed with an odious leer of affected knowingness
as 'my dear,' wink, etc. Now to this tends the false
condition of women when called 'the ladies.' On the
other hand, what an awful elevation arises when each
views in the other a creature capable of the same noble
duties&mdash;she no less than he a creature of lofty aspirations;
she by the same right a daughter of God as he a
son of God; she bearing her eyes erect to the heavens
no less than he!</p>

<br />
<p><i>Low Degree.</i>&mdash;We see often that this takes place very
strongly and decidedly with regard to men, notoriously
pleasant men and remarkably good-natured, which
shows at once in what road the thing travels. And if
such a nature should be combined with what Butler
thinks virtue, it might be doubtful to which of the two
the tribute of kind attentions were paid; but now seeing
the true case, we know how to interpret this hypothetical
case of Butler's accordingly.</p>

<p>'Visit the sins of the fathers,' etc. This people pretend

and must happen to Jews inheriting by filial obedience
and natural sympathy all that anti-Christian hostility
which prevailed in the age succeeding to that of Christ?
What evil&mdash;of suffering, of penalties now or in reserve
may be attached to this spirit of hostility&mdash;follows the
children through all generations!</p>

<br />
<p>Case of Timoleon, whose killing of his brother might
afterwards be read into X Y Z or into X a b according
to his conduct (either into murder or patriotism), is a
good illustration of synthesis.</p>

<p>To illustrate Cicero's argument in 'Pro C&aelig;lio' as to
the frequency of men wild and dissipated in youth
becoming eminent citizens, one might adduce this case
from the word <i>Themistocles</i> in the Index to the Gr&aelig;ci
Rhetorici. But I see or I fancy cause to notice this
passage for the following cause: it contains only nine
words, four in the first comma, five in the last, and of
these nine four are taken up in noting the time <ins class="mycorr" title="to prôton
to telen">&#964;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#957;</ins>; ergo, five words record the remarkable revolution
from one state to another, and the character of
each state.</p>

<p>Two cases of young men's dissipation&mdash;1. Horace's
record of his father's advice: 'Concessa,' etc.; 2. Cicero's
'Pro C&aelig;lio.'</p>

<br />
<p><i>What Crotchets in every Direction!</i>&mdash;1. The Germans,
or, let me speak more correctly, some of the Germans
(and doubtless full of Hoch beer or strong drink),
found out some thirty years ago that there were only
three men of genius in the records of our planet.
And who were they? (1) Homer; (2) Shakespeare;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
(3) Goethe. So that absolutely Milton was shut out
from the constellation. Even he wanted a ticket,
though Master Sorrows-of-Werther had one. The
porter, it seems, fancied he had no marriage garment,
a mistake which a mob might correct, saying,
'No marriage garment! then, damme, he shall have
this fellow's' (viz., Goethe's). The trinity, according to
these vagabonds, was complete without Milton, as the
Roman pomp was full to the eye of the sycophant
without the bust of Brutus.</p>

<p>2. Macaulay fancied there were only two men of
genius in the reign of Charles II., viz., Milton and the
tinker Bunyan.</p>

<p>3. Coleridge (p. 237, 'Table-Talk') fancied there were
only two men of genius in his own generation: W. W.
and Sir Humphrey Davy.</p>

<br />
<p>Jeremy Taylor having mentioned two religious men,
St. Paul the Hermit and Sulpitius, as having atoned
for some supposed foolish garrulities, the one by a three
years' silence, the other by a lifelong silence, goes on to
express his dissatisfaction with a mode of <i>rabiosa silentia</i>
so memorable as this.</p>

<p>Yet it is certain in silence there is wisdom, and there
may be deep religion. And indeed it is certain, great
knowledge, if it be without vanity, is the most severe
bridle of the tongue. For so I have heard that all the
noises and prating of the pool, the croaking of frogs and
toads, is hushed and appeased upon the instant of bringing
upon them the light of a candle or torch. Every
beam of reason and ray of knowledge checks the dissoluteness
of the tongue. 'Ut quisque contemplissimus
est, ita solutissim&aelig; lingu&aelig; est,' said Seneca.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>The silence must be <ins class="mycorr" title="kairios">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins>, not sullen and ill-natured;
'nam sic etiam tacuisse nocet'?&mdash;of all things in the
world a prating religion and much talk in holy things
does most profane the mysteriousness of it, and dismantles
its regard, and makes cheap its reverence and takes off
fear and awfulness, and makes it loose and garish, and
like the laughters of drunkenness.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Public Morality.</i>&mdash;It ought not to be left to a man's
interest merely to protect the animals in his power.
Dogs are no longer worked in the way they were,
although the change must have arbitrarily robbed many
poor men of half bread. But in a case as valuable as
that of the horse, it has been known that a man has
incurred the total ruin of a series of horses against even
his own gain or self-interest. There ought to be a
<i>custos veteranorum</i>, a keeper and protector of the poor
brutes who are brought within the pale of social use
and service. The difficulty, you say! Legislation has
met and dealt effectively with far more complicated and
minute matters than that. For, after all, consider how
few of the brute creation on any wide and permanent
scale are brought into the scheme of human life. Some
birds as food, some fishes as ditto; beeves as food and
<i>sometimes</i> as appliers of strength; horses in both
characters. These with elephants and camels, mules,
asses, goats, dogs, and sheep, cats and rabbits, gold-fishes
and singing-birds, really compose the whole of
our animal equipage harnessed to the car of human life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>


<h3>3.&mdash;On Words And Style.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<p>There are a number of words which, unlocked from
their absurd imprisonment, would become extensively
useful. We should say, for instance, 'condign honours,'
'condign treatment' (treatment appropriate to the
merits), thus at once realizing two rational purposes,
viz., giving a useful function to a word, which at present
has none, and also providing an intelligible expression
for an idea which otherwise is left without means of
uttering itself except through a ponderous circumlocution.
Precisely in the same circumstances of idle and absurd
sequestration stands the term <i>polemic.</i> At present, according
to the popular usage, this word has some fantastic
inalienable connection with controversial theology.
There cannot be a more childish chimera. No doubt
there is a polemic side or aspect of theology; but so
there is of <i>all</i> knowledge; so there is of <i>every</i> science.
The radical and characteristic idea concerned in this
term <i>polemic</i> is found in our own Parliamentary distinction
of <i>the good speaker</i>, as contrasted with <i>the good
debater.</i> The good speaker is he who unfolds the whole
of a question in its affirmative aspects, who presents
these aspects in their just proportions, and according to
their orderly and symmetrical deductions from each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
other. But the good debater is he who faces the negative
aspects of the question, who meets sudden objections,
has an answer for any momentary summons of doubt or
difficulty, dissipates seeming inconsistencies, and reconciles
the geometrical smoothness of <i>&agrave; priori</i> abstractions
with the coarse angularities of practical experience. The
great work of Ricardo is of necessity, and almost in
every page, polemic; whilst very often the particular
objections or difficulties, to which it replies, are not indicated
at all, being spread through entire systems, and
assumed as <i>precognita</i> that are familiar to the learned
student.</p>

<br />
<p>Writing to scholastic persons, I should be ashamed to
explain, but hoping that I write to many also of the
non-scholastic, and even of the unlearned, I rejoice to
explain the proper sense of the word <i>implicit.</i> As the
word <i>condign</i>, so capable of an extended sense, is yet
constantly restricted to one miserable association, viz.,
that with the word <i>punishment</i> (for we never say, as we
might say, 'condign rewards'), so also the word <i>implicit</i>
is in English always associated with the word <i>faith.</i>
People say that Papists have an <i>implicit</i> faith in their
priests. What they mean is this: If a piece of arras, or
a carpet, is folded up, then it is <i>implicit</i> according to the
original Latin word; if it is unfolded and displayed, then
it is <i>explicit.</i> Therefore, when a poor illiterate man
(suppose a bog-trotter of Mayo or Galway) says to his
priest (as in effect always he <i>does</i> say), 'Sir, I cannot
comprehend all this doctrine; bless you, I have not the
thousandth part of the learning for it, so it is impossible
that I should directly believe it. But your reverence
believes it, the thing is <i>wrapt up</i> (implicit) in you, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
believe it on that account.' Here the priest believes explicitly:
<i>he</i> believes implicitly.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Modern.</i>&mdash;Is it not shameful that to this hour even
literary men of credit and repute cannot for the life of
them interpret this line from 'As You Like It'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Full of wise saws and modern instances'?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A man as well read as Mr. Theodore Hook, and many a
hundred beside, have seriously understood it to mean
'Full of old proverbs, the traditionary wisdom of nations,
and of illustrative examples drawn from modern experience.'
Nonsense! The meaning is, 'Full of old
maxims and proverbs, and of trivial attempts at argument.'
That is, tediously redundant in rules derived
from the treasury of popular proverbs,' and in feeble
attempts at connecting these general rules with the
special case before him. The superannuated old magistrate
sets out with a proverb, as for instance this, that
<i>the mother of mischief is no bigger than a midge's wing.</i>
That proverb forms his major proposition. In his minor
proposition he goes on to argue that the trespass charged
upon the particular prisoner before him was very little
bigger than a midge's wing. And then in his conclusion
triumphantly he infers, Ergo, the prisoner at the bar is
the mother of mischief. But says the constable, 'Please,
your worship, the prisoner is a man, a hulking clodhopper,
some six or seven feet high, with a strong black beard.'
'Well, that makes no odds,' rejoins his worship; 'then
he's the father of mischief. Clerk, make out his mittimus.'</p>

<p>The word 'instance' (from the scholastic <i>instantia</i>)
never meant <i>example</i> in Shakespeare's age. The word
'modern' never once in Shakespeare means what it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
means to <i>us</i> in these days. Even the monkish Latin
word 'modernus' fluctuated in meaning, and did not
always imply <i>recens</i>, <i>neotericus</i>; but in Shakespeare
never. What <i>does</i> it mean in Shakespeare? Once and
for ever it means <i>trivial</i>, <i>inconsiderable.</i> Dr. Johnson
had too much feeling not to perceive that the word
'modern' had this value in Shakespeare's acceptation;
practically, he felt that it <i>availed</i> for that sense, but
theoretically he could not make out the <i>why.</i> It means
that, said the Doctor; but feebly and querulously, like
one sick of the pip, he added, 'Yet I don't know why.'
Don't you? Now, we <i>do.</i> The fact is, Dr. Johnson was
in a fit of the dismals at that time; he had recently
committed a debauch of tea, having exceeded his usual
allowance by seventy-five cups, so that naturally he had
a 'curmurring' in the stomach. Else he could not have
failed to see what we are now going to explain with a
wet finger. Everybody is aware that to be <i>material</i> is
the very opposite of being trivial. What is 'material' in
a chain of evidence, or in an argument, can never be
trifling. Now, therefore, if you can find a word that
will flatly contradict this word <i>material</i>, then you have a
capital term for expressing what is trivial. Well, you
find in the word <i>immaterial</i> all that you are seeking. 'It
is quite immaterial' will suit Mr. Touts's purpose just as
well as 'It is really of no consequence, of no consequence
in the world.' To say in a law court that the objection
is immaterial is otherwise to say that it is trivial.
Here, then, is the first step: to contradict the idea of
<i>material</i> is effectually to express the idea of <i>trivial.</i> Let
us now see if we can find any other contradiction to the
idea of <i>material</i>, for one antithesis to that idea will
express as well as any other antithesis the counterpole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the trivial. Now, clearly the substance of a thing, the
material out of which it is made, is oftentimes of great
importance by comparison with its shape, fashion, or
mode. It is of value in your eyes to know whether your
family plate is in substance of gold or of silver; but
whether such a vessel is round or square, ornamented
with a wreath of acanthus or ivy, supported by tigers or
by fawns, may be a trivial consideration, or even worse;
for the fashion of your plate, after it has once become
obsolete, may count against you for so much loss as
something that will cost a good deal of money to alter.
Here, then, is another contradiction to the material, and
therefore another expression for the trivial: matter, as
against vacancy or the privation of matter, yields the
antithesis of material or immaterial, substantial and
unsubstantial; matter, as against form, yields the antithesis
of substance and shape, or otherwise of material
and modal&mdash;what is matter and what is the mere modification
of matter, its variation by means of ornament or
shape.</p>

<p>The word 'modern' is therefore in Shakespeare uniformly
to be pronounced with the long <i>o</i>, as in the words
m<i>o</i>dal, m<i>o</i>dish, and never with the short <i>o</i> of m&#335;derate,
m&#335;dest, or our present word m&#335;dern. And the law
under which Shakespeare uses the word is this: whatsoever
is so trivial as to fall into the relation of a mere
shape or fleeting mode to a permanent substance, <i>that</i>
with Shakespeare is modish, or (according to his form)
modern.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Thus, a weak, trivial argument (or <i>instantia</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>the scholastic term for an argument not latent merely, or
merely having the office of sustaining a truth, but urged
as an objection, having the polemic office of contradicting
an opponent) is in Shakespeare's idiom, when viewed as
against a substantial argument, a <i>modern</i> argument.</p>

<p>Again, when Cleopatra, defending herself against the
perfidy of her steward, wishes to impress upon Octavius
that any articles which she may have kept back from the
inventory of her personal chattels are but trifles, she expresses
this by saying that they are but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Such as we greet modern friends withal;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, such as we bestow, at welcoming or at parting, upon
the slightest acquaintances. The whole stress of the
logic lies upon the epithet <i>modern</i>&mdash;for simply as friends,
had they been substantial friends, they might have levied
any amount from the royal lady's bounty; kingdoms
would have been slight gifts in her eyes, and <i>that</i> would
soon have been objected to by her conqueror. But her
argument is, that the people to whom such gifts would
be commensurate are mere <i>modish</i> friends, persons
known to us on terms of bare civility, people with whom
we exchange salutations in the street, or occasional calls,
what now we call acquaintances, for whom in Shakespeare's
time there was no distinguishing expression.</p>

<p>Another case we remember at this moment in 'All's
Well that Ends Well.' It occurs in Act II., at the very
opening of scene iii.; the particular edition, the only one
we can command at the moment, is an obscure one published
by Scott, Webster and Geary, Charterhouse Square,
1840, and we mention it thus circumstantially because
the passage is falsely punctuated; and we have little doubt
that in all other editions, whether with or without the
false punctuation, the syntax is generally misapprehended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
In reality, the false punctuation has itself grown out of
the false apprehension of the syntax, and not <i>vice vers&acirc;.</i>
Thus the words stand <i>literatim et punctuatim</i>: 'They
say, miracles are past: and we have our philosophical
persons to make modern and familiar things,
supernatural and causeless.' The comma ought to have
been placed after 'familiar,' the sense being this&mdash;and
we have amongst us sceptical and irreligious people to
represent as trivial and of daily occurrence things which
in reality are supernatural and causeless (that is, not
lying amongst the succession of physical causes and
effects, but sent as miracles by the immediate agency of
God). According to the true sense, <i>things supernatural
and causeless</i> must be understood as the subject, of which
<i>modern and familiar</i> is the predicate.</p>

<br />
<p>Mr. Grindon fancies that <i>frog</i> is derived from the
syllable <ins class="mycorr" title="trach">&#964;&#961;&#945;&#967;</ins> of <ins class="mycorr" title="batrachos">&#946;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#959;&#962;</ins>. This will cause some people
to smile, and recall Menage's pleasantry about Alfana,
the man of Orlando; It is true that <i>frog</i> at first sight
seems to have no letter in common except the snarling
letter (<i>litera canina</i>). But this is not so; the <i>a</i> and the
<i>o</i>, the <i>s</i> and the <i>k</i>, are perhaps essentially the same.
And even in the case where, positively and literally, not
a single letter is identical, it is odd, but undeniable, that
the two words may be nearly allied as mother and child.
One instance is notorious, but it is worth citing for a
purpose of instructive inference. 'Journal,' as a French
word, or, if you please, as an English word&mdash;whence
came that? Unquestionably and demonstrably from the
Latin word <i>dies</i>, in which, however, visibly there is not
one letter the same as any one of the seven that are in
journal. Yet mark the rapidity of the transition. <i>Dies</i>
(a day) has for its derivative adjective <i>daily</i> the word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
<i>diurnus.</i> Now, the old Roman pronunciation of <i>diu</i> was
exactly the same as <i>gio</i>, both being pronounced as our
English <i>jorn.</i> Here, in a moment, we see the whole&mdash;<i>giorno</i>,
a day, was not derived directly from <i>dies</i>, but
secondarily through <i>diurnus.</i> Then followed <i>giornal</i>,
for a diary, or register of a day, and from that to French,
as also, of course, the English <i>journal.</i> But the <i>moral</i>
is, that when to the eye no letter is the same, may it not
be so to the ear? Already the <i>di</i> of <i>dies</i> anticipates and
enfolds the <i>giorno.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Grindon justly remarks upon the tendency, in
many instances, of the German <i>ss</i> to reappear in English
forms as <i>t.</i> Thus <i>heiss</i> (hot), <i>fuss</i> (foot), etc. These are
Mr. Grindon's own examples, and a striking confirmation
occurs in the old English <i>hight</i>, used for <i>he was called</i>,
and again for the participle <i>called</i>, and again, in the 'Met.
Romanus,' for <i>I was called</i>: 'Lorde, he saide, I highth
Segramour.' Now, the German is <i>heissen</i> (to be called).
And this is a tendency hidden in many long ages: as,
for instance, in Greek, every person must remember
the transition of <ins class="mycorr" title="tt">&#964;&#964;</ins> and <ins class="mycorr" title="ss">&#963;&#963;</ins> as
 in <ins class="mycorr" title="thatt&ocirc;">&#952;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#969;</ins>, <ins class="mycorr" title="thass&ocirc;">&#952;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#969;</ins>.</p>

<br />
<p><i>On Pronunciation and Spelling.</i>&mdash;If we are to surrender
the old vernacular sound of the <i>e</i> in certain situations to
a ridiculous criticism of the <i>eye</i>, and in defiance of the
protests rising up clamorously from every quarter of old
English scholarship, let us at least know to <i>what</i> we
surrender. What letter is to usurp the vacant seat?
What letter? retorts the purist&mdash;why, an <i>e</i>, to be sure.
An <i>e</i>? And do you call <i>that</i> an <i>e</i>? Do you pronounce
'ten' as if it were written 'tun', or 'men' as if written
'mun'? The 'Der' in Derby, supposing it tolerable at
all to alter its present legitimate sound, ought, then, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
be pronounced as the 'Der' in the Irish name Derry,
not as 'Dur'; and the 'Ber' in Berkeley not as 'Bur,' but
as the 'Ber' in Beryl. But the whole conceit has its
origin in pure ignorance of English arch&aelig;ology, and in
the windiest of all vanities, viz., the attempt to harmonize
the spelling and the pronunciation of languages.</p>

<p>Naturally, it fills one with contempt for these 'Derby'
purists to find that their own object, the very purpose
they are blindly and unconsciously aiming at, has been
so little studied or steadily contemplated by them in
anything approaching to its whole extent. Why, upon
the principle which they silently and virtually set up,
though carrying it out so contradictorily (driving out an
<i>a</i> on the plea that it is not an <i>e</i>, only to end by substituting,
<i>and without being aware</i>, the still remoter letter
<i>u</i>), the consequence must be that the whole language
would go to wreck. Nine names out of every ten would
need tinkering. 'London,' for instance, no more receives
the normal sound of the <i>o</i> in either of its syllables than
does the <i>e</i> in 'Derby.' The normal sound of the <i>o</i> is
that heard in 'song,' 'romp,' 'homage,' 'drop.' Nevertheless,
the sound given to the <i>o</i> in 'London,' 'Cromwell,'
etc., which strictly is the short sound of <i>u</i> in
'lubber,' 'butter,' etc., is a secondary sound of <i>o</i> in
particular combinations, though not emphatically its
proper sound. The very same defence applies to the <i>e</i>
in 'Berkeley,' etc. It is the legitimate sound of the
English <i>e</i> in that particular combination, viz., when
preceding an <i>r</i>, though not its normal sound. But think
of the wild havoc that would be made of other more
complex anomalies, if these purists looked an inch in
advance. Glocester or Gloucester, Worcester, Cirencester,
Pontefract, etc. What elaborate and monstrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
pronunciations would they affix to these names? The
whole land would cease to recognise itself. And that
the purists should never have contemplated these
veritable results, this it is which seals and rivets one's
contempt for them.</p>

<p>Now, if such harmony were at all desirable (whereas,
on the contrary, we should thus be carrying ruin into
the traditions and obliteration into the ethnological links
of languages, industriously, in fact, throwing up insuperable
obstacles in the path of historical researches), it
would be far better, instead of adjusting the pronunciation
to the imaginary value of the spelling, inversely to adjust
the spelling to the known and established pronunciation,
as a certain class of lunatics amongst ourselves, viz., the
<i>phonetic gang</i>, have for some time been doing systematically.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, I hope is one fixed point. Here there
is anchorage. The usage is the rule, at any rate; and
the law of analogy takes effect only where <i>that</i> cannot be
decisively ascertained.</p>

<br />
<p><i>The Latin Word 'Felix.'</i>&mdash;The Romans appear to me to
have had no term for <i>happy</i>, which argues that they had
not the idea. <i>Felix</i> is tainted with the idea of success,
and is thus palpably referred to life as a competition,
which for Romans every distinguished life was. In fact,
apart from his city the Roman was nothing. Too poor
to have a villa or any mode of retirement, it is clear that
the very idea of Roman life supposes for the vast majority
a necessity of thick crowded intercourse, without the
possibility of solitude. I, for my peculiar constitution of
mind, to whom solitude has in all periods of life been
more of a necessity almost than air, view with special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
horror the life of a Roman or Athenian. All the morning
he had to attend a factious hustings or a court&mdash;assemblies
deliberative or judicial. Here only he was somebody,
and yet, however, somebody through others. Combining
with one leader and many underlings like himself, he
also became a power; but in himself and for himself,
after all, he was consciously nothing. When Cicero
speaks of his <i>nunquam minus Solus quam cum solus</i>, he is
announcing what he feels to be, and knows will be, accepted
as a very extraordinary fact. For even <i>in rure</i> it
is evident that friends made it a duty of friendship to
seek out and relieve their rusticating friends.</p>

<br />
<p><i>On the Distinction between 'Rhetorica utens' and 'Rhetorica
docens'.</i>&mdash;It was a perplexity, familiar to the experience
of the Schoolmen, that oftentimes one does not
know whether to understand by the term <i>logic</i> the act
and process of reasoning involved and latent in any series
of connected propositions, or this same act and process
formally abstracting itself as an art and system of reasoning.
For instance, if you should happen to say, 'Dr.
Isaac Watts, the English Nonconformist, was a good
man, and a clever man; but alas! for his logic, what can
his best friend say for it? The most charitable opinion
must pronounce it at the best so, so'&mdash;in such a case,
what is it that you would be understood to speak of?
Would it be the general quality of the Doctor's reasoning,
the style and character of his philosophical method, or
would it be the particular little book known as 'The
Doctor: his <i>Logic</i>,' price 5s., bound in calf, and which
you might be very shy of touching with a pair of tongs,
for fear of dimming their steel polish, so long as your
wife's eye was upon your motions? The same ambiguity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
affects many other cases. For instance, if you heard a
man say, 'The <i>rhetoric</i> of Cicero is not fitted to challenge
much interest,' you might naturally understand it of the
particular style and rhetorical colouring&mdash;which was taxed
with being florid; nay, Rhodian; nay, even Asiatic&mdash;that
characterizes that great orator's compositions; or, again,
the context might so restrain the word as to <i>force</i> it into
meaning the particular system or theory of rhetoric
addressed to Herennius, a system which (being traditionally
ascribed to Cicero) is usually printed amongst his
works. Here, and in scores of similar cases, lies often a
trap for the understanding; but the Schoolmen evaded
this trap by distinguishing between 'Rhetorica <i>utens</i>,'
and 'Rhetorica <i>docens</i>,' between the rhetoric that laid
down or delivered didactically the elements of oratorical
persuasion as an art to be learned, and rhetoric, on the
other hand, as a creative energy that <i>wielded</i> these elements
by the mouth of Pericles in the year 440 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, or
by the mouth of Demosthenes, 340 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>; between rhetoric
the scholastic art and rhetoric the heaven-born <i>power;</i>
between the rhetoric of Aristotle that illuminated the
solitary student, and the rhetoric of Demosthenes that
ran along in rolling thunders to the footstool of Artaxerxes'
throne. Oh, these dear spindle-shanked Schoolmen! they
were people, respected reader, not to be sneezed at. What
signifies having spindle-shanks?</p>

<br />
<p><i>Synonyms.</i>&mdash;A representative and a delegate, according
to Burke, are identical; but there is the
same difference as between a person who on his own
results of judgment manages the interests of X, and a
person merely reporting the voice of X. Probably there
never was a case which so sharply illustrated the liability<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of goodish practical understanding to miss, to fail in seeing,
an object lying right before the eyes; and that is
more wonderful in cases where the object is not one of
multitude, but exists almost in a state of insulation. At
the coroner's inquest on a young woman who died from
tight-lacing, acting, it was said, in combination with a
very full meal of animal food, to throw the heart out of
position, Mr. Wakely pronounced English or British
people all distorted in the spine, whereas <i>Continental</i>
people were all right. Continental! How unlimited an
idea! Why, it meant nothing; it defines nothing, limits
nothing, excludes nothing. Who or what is Continental?
Apparently it means anyone out of 240 millions not
being one of the 27 millions in the Britannides. Every
man escapes an insane folly who happens to breathe an
air E. (N. E., S. E., N. N. E., S. S. E., etc.) of the Britannides.
Vanity, the inevitable wish to improve, or rather
to avail, one's self of a natural means offered for deepening
and marking out the natural outline of the shape, <i>i.e.</i>,
of the sexual characteristics, has no effect, dies out, the
instant that a family is one of those who have the privilege
of basking anywhere 2,000 miles E. or 2,000 miles N.

<p><i>Syllogism.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Edin. Advertiser</i> for Friday, January

du Nord</i>), or some paper whose accurate title I do not know,
understood to be Russian in its leanings, which makes a
most absurd and ignorant use of this word. The Allies are
represented as addressing an argument to Russia, amounting,
I think, to this, viz.: that, in order to test her sincerity,
would it not be well for Russia at once to cede
such insulated points of territory as were valuable to
Russia or suspicious to the Allies simply as furnishing
means for invasion of Turkey? And this argument is
called a <i>syllogism.</i></p>

<br />
<p>'<i>Laid in wait</i> for him.'&mdash;This false phrase occurs in some
article (a Crimea article, I suppose) in the same <i>Advertiser</i>
of January 25. And I much doubt whether any ordinary
ear would reconcile itself to <i>lay in wait</i> (as a <i>past</i> tense)
even when instructed in its propriety.</p>

<p>In the <i>Lady's Newspaper</i> for Saturday, May 8, 1852
(No. 280), occurs the very worst case of exaggerated and
incredible mixed silliness and vulgarity connected with
the use of <i>assist</i> for <i>help</i> at the dinner-table that I have
met with. It occurs in the review of a book entitled
'The Illustrated London Cookery Book,' by Frederick
Bishop. Mr. Bishop, it seems, had 'enjoyed the office
of cuisinier at the Palace, and among some of our first
nobility.' He has, by the way, an introductory 'Philosophy
of Cookery.' Two cases occur of this matchless
absurdity:</p>

<p>1. An ideal carver is described: he, after carving, 'is
as cool and collected as ever, and <i>assists</i> the portions he
has carved with as much grace as he displayed in carving
the fowl.'</p>

<p>2. Further on, when contrasting, not the carvers, but
the things <i>to be</i> carved, coming to '<i>Neck of Veal</i>,' he says
of the carver: 'Should the vertebr&aelig; have not been
jointed by the butcher, you would find yourself in the
position of the ungraceful carver, being compelled to
exercise a degree of strength which should never be
suffered to appear, very possibly, too, <i>assisting</i> gravy in
a manner not contemplated by the person unfortunate
enough to receive it.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p><i>Genteel</i> is the vulgarest and most plebeian of all
known words. Accordingly (and strange it is that the
educated users of this word should not perceive that
fact), aristocratic people&mdash;people in the most undoubted
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of society as to rank or connections&mdash;utterly ignore
the word. They are aware of its existence in English
dictionaries; they know that it slumbers in those vast
repositories; they even apprehend your meaning in a
vague way when you employ it as an epithet for assigning
the pretensions of an individual or a family. Generally
it is understood to imply that the party so described
is in a position to make morning calls, to leave cards, to
be presentable for anything to the contrary apparent in
manners, style of conversation, etc. But these and
other suggestions still leave a vast area unmapped of
blank charts in which the soundings are still doubtful.</p>

<p>The word 'genteel' is so eminently vulgar apparently
for this reason, that it presents a non-vulgar distinction
under a gross and vulgar conception of that distinction.
The true and central notion, on which the word revolves,
is elevating; but, by a false abstraction of its elements,
it is degraded. And yet in parts of this island where
the progress of refinement is torpid, and the field of
vision is both narrow and unchanging in all that regards
the <i>nuances</i> of manners, I have remarked that the word
'genteel' maintains its old advantageous acceptation;
and as a proof of this, eminent and even revolutionary
thinkers born and bred in such provincial twilight, use
the word as if untainted and hardly aware that it is flyblown.</p>

<p>Among ourselves it is certain that a peculiar style of
gossip, of babble, and of miniature intriguing, invests the
atmosphere of little 'townishness,' such as often en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>tangles
the more thoughtful and dignified of the residents
in troublesome efforts at passive resistance or active
counter-action. In dealing with this matter, Mr. Wordsworth
instanced Northampton and Nottingham; but a
broader difference could hardly be than between these
towns. And just as 'genteel' remains the vulgarest of
all words, so the words 'simple' and 'simplicity,' amongst
all known words, offer the most complex and least simple
of ideas.</p>

<p>Having made this deprecation on behalf of my own
criminality in using such a word as 'genteel,' I go on to
say that whilst Northampton was (and <i>is</i>, I believe) of
all towns the most genteel, Nottingham for more than
two centuries has been the most insurrectionary and in a
scarlet excess democratic. Nottingham, in fact, has
always resembled the Alexandria of ancient days; whilst
Northampton could not be other than aristocratic as the
centre of a county more thickly gemmed by the ancestral
seats of our nobility than any beside in the island. Norwich,
again, though a seat of manufacturing industry,
has always been modified considerably by a literary body
of residents.</p>

<p>'Mein alter Herr' (von Stein) 'pflegte dann wohl
scherzend zu sagen: Ich m&uuml;sse von irgend eine Hexe
meinen Altem als ein Wechselbalg in's Nest gelegt seyn;
ich geh&ouml;re offenbar einem Stamm amerikanischer wilden
an, und habe noch die H&uuml;hnerhundnase zum Auswittern
des verschiedenen Blutes.' Arndt, speaking of his
power to detect at sight (when seen at a distance)
Russians, English, etc., says that Von Stein replied thus
in his surprise. But I have cited the passage as one
which amply illustrates the suspensive form of sentence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
in the German always indicated by a colon (:), thus: 'zu
sagen: Ich m&uuml;sse'&mdash;to say that I must have been

<br />
<p>The active sense of <i>fearful</i>, viz., that which causes and
communicates terror&mdash;not that which receives terror&mdash;was
undoubtedly in Shakespeare's age, but especially
amongst poets, the preponderant sense. Accordingly I
am of opinion that even in neutral cases, such as are
open indifferently to either sense, viz., that which affrights,
or that which is itself affrighted, the bias in Shakespeare's
interpretation of the feeling lay towards the former movement.
For instance, in one of his sonnets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oh, fearful meditation! where, alas!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the true construction I believe to be&mdash;not this: Oh,
though <i>deriving</i> terror from the circumstances surrounding
thee, <i>suffering</i> terror from the <i>entourage</i> of considerations
pursuing thee; but this: Oh, thought impressing and
creating terror, etc. A 'fearful' agent in Shakespeare's
use is not one that shrinks in alarm from the act, but an
agent that causes others to shrink; not panic-struck, but
panic-striking.</p>

<br />
<p>Miss Edgeworth, let me remark, commits trespasses
on language that are really past excusing. In one place
she says that a man 'had a <i>contemptible</i> opinion' of some
other man's understanding. Such a blunder is not of
that class which usage sanctions, and an accuracy not
much short of pedantry would be argued in noticing: it
is at once illiterate and vulgar in the very last degree. I
mean that it is common amongst vulgar people, and them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
only. It ranks, for instance, with the common formula
of '<i>I</i> am agreeable, if you prefer it.'</p>

<p>Religion under any of its aspects, revealing or consoling&mdash;religion
in connection with any of its affinities, ethics
or metaphysics, when <i>self</i>-evoked by a person of earnest
nature, not imposed from without by the necessities of
monastic life, not caught as a contagion from the example
of friends that surround you, argues some 'vast volcanic
agency' moving at subterraneous depths below the ordinary
working mind of daily life, and entitled by its own
intrinsic grandeur to ennoble the curiosity (else a petty
passion) which may put questions as to its origin. In
any case of religion arising, as a spontaneous birth, in the
midst of alien forces, it is inevitable to ask for its <i>why</i>
and its <i>whence.</i> Religion considered as a sentiment of
devotion, as a yearning after some dedication to an immeasurable
principle of that noblest temple among all
temples&mdash;'the upright heart and pure,' or religion, again,
as the apprehension of some mighty synthesis amongst
truths dimly perceived heretofore amidst separating
clouds, but now brought into strict indissoluble connection,
proclaims a revolution so great that it is otherwise not to
be accounted for than as the breaking out of a germ of
the supernatural in man as a seed from a hitherto barren
soil.</p>

<p>Sin is that secret word, that dark <i>aporr&eacute;ton</i> of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
human race, undiscoverable except by express revelation,
which having once been laid in the great things of God
as a germinal principle, has since blossomed into a vast
growth of sublime ideas known only to those nations
who have lived under the moulding of Scriptural truth&mdash;and
comprehending <i>all</i> functions of the Infinite operatively
familiar to man. Yes, I affirm that there is no form
through which the Infinite reveals itself in a sense comprehensible
by man and adequate to man; that there is
no sublime agency which <i>compresses</i> the human mind from
infancy so as to mingle with the moments of its growth,
positively none but has been in its whole origin&mdash;in every
part&mdash;and exclusively developed out of that tremendous
mystery which lurks under the name of sin.</p>

<p>Yes, I affirm that even in its dreams every Christian
child is invested by an atmosphere of sublimity unknown
to the greatest of Pagan philosophers: that golden rays
reach it by two functions of the Infinite; and that these,
in common with those emanations of the Infinite that do
not settle upon the mind until mature years, are all
projections&mdash;derivations or counterpositions&mdash;from the
obscure idea of sin; could not have existed under any
previous condition; and for a Pagan mind would not
have been intelligible.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Sin.</i>&mdash;It is not only that the Infinite arises as part of
the entire system resting on sin, but specifically from sin
apart from its counterforces or reactions, viz., from sin
as a thing, and the only thing originally shadowy and in
a terrific sense mysterious.</p>

<p><i>Stench.</i>&mdash;I believe that under Burke's commentary,
this idea would become a high test of the doctrine of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Infinite. He pronounces it sublime, or sublime in cases
of intensity. Now, first of all, the intense state of everything
or anything is but a mode of power, that idea or
element or moment of greatness under a varied form.
Here, then, is nothing <i>proper</i> or separately peculiar to
stench: it is not stench <i>as</i> stench, but stench as a mode
or form of sensation, capable therefore of intensification.
It is but a case under what we may suppose a general
Kantian rule&mdash;that every sensation runs through all
gradations, from the lowest or most obscure and nascent
to the highest. Secondly, however, pass over to the
contemplation of stench <i>as</i> stench: then I affirm&mdash;that
as simply expounding the decay, and altering or spoiling
tendency or state of all things&mdash;simply as a register of
imperfection, and of one which does not (as ruins to the
eye) ever put on a pleasing transitional aspect, it is
merely disagreeable, but also at the same time mean.
For the imperfection is merely transitional and fleeting,
not absolute. First, midst and last, it is or can be grand
when it reverts or comes round upon its mediating point,
or point of reaction.</p>

<br />
<p>The arrangement of my Infinite must be thus: After
having expounded the idea of holiness which I must
show to be now potent, proceed to show that the Pagan
Gods did not realize and did not meet this idea; that
then came the exposure of the Pagan Gods and the conscious
presence of a new force among mankind, which
opened up the idea of the Infinite, through the awakening
perception of holiness.</p>

<br />
<p>I believe that in every mode of existence, which probably
is always by an incarnation, the system of flesh is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
made to yield the organs that express the alliance of man
with the Infinite. Thus the idea of mystery, <ins class="mycorr" title="aporr&ecirc;ta">&#945;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#945;</ins>,
finds its organ of expression in the sensualities of the
human race. Again, the crime, whatever it were, and
the eternal pollution is expressed in these same organs.
Also, the prolongation of the race so as to find another
system is secured by the same organs.</p>

<br />
<p>Generally, that is, for a million against a unit, the
awful mystery by which the fearful powers of death,
and sorrow, and pain, and sin are locked into parts of a
whole; so as, in fact, to be repetitions, reaffirmations of
each other under a different phase&mdash;this is nothing, does
not exist. Death sinks to a mere collective term&mdash;a
category&mdash;a word of convenience for purposes of arrangement.
You depress your hands, and, behold! the system
disappears; you raise them, it reappears. This is nothing&mdash;a
cipher, a shadow. Clap your hands like an Arabian
girl, and all comes back. Unstop your ears, and a roar
as of St. Lawrence enters: stop your ears, and it is
muffled. To and fro; it is and it is not&mdash;is not and is.
Ah, mighty heaven, that such a mockery should cover
the whole vision of life! It is and it is not; and on to
the day of your death you will still have to learn what is
the truth.</p>

<p>The eternal now through the dreadful loom is the
overflowing future poured back into the capacious reservoir
of the past. All the active element lies in that
infinitesimal <i>now.</i> The future is not except by relation;
the past is not at all, and the present but a sign of a
nexus between the two.</p>

<br />
<p>God's words require periods, so His counsels. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
cannot precipitate them any more than a man in a state
of happiness <i>can</i> commit suicide. Doubtless it is undeniable
that a man may arm his hand with a sword: and
that his flesh will be found penetrable to the sword,
happy or not. But this apparent physical power has
no existence, no value for a creature having a double
nature: the moral nature not only indisposes him to use
his power, but really creates a far greater antagonist
power.</p>

<br />
<p>This God&mdash;too great to be contemplated steadily by
the loftiest of human eyes; too approachable and condescending
to be shunned by the meanest in affliction:
realizing thus in another form that reconcilement of
extremes, which St. Paul observed: far from all created
beings, yet also very near.</p>

<br />
<p>'A conviction that they needed a Saviour was growing
amongst men.' How? In what sense? Saviour from
what? You can't be saved from nothing. There must
be a danger, an evil threatening, before even in fancy
you can think of a deliverer. Now, what evil was there
existing to a Pagan? Sin? Monstrous! No such idea
ever dawned upon the Pagan intellect. Death? Yes;
but that was inalienable from his nature. Pain and
disease? Yes; but these were perhaps inalienable also.
Mitigated they might be, but it must be by human
science, and the progress of knowledge. Grief? Yes;
but this was inalienable from life. Mitigated it might
be, but by superior philosophy. From what, then, was
a Saviour to save? If nothing to save from, how any
Saviour? But here arises as the awful of awfuls to me,
the deep, deep exposure of the insufficient knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and sense of what is peculiar to Christianity. To
imagine some sense of impurity, etc., leading to a wish
for a Saviour in a Pagan, is to defraud Christianity of all
its grandeur. If Paganism could develop the want, it is
not at all clear that Paganism did not develop the
remedy. Heavens! how deplorable a blindness! But
did not a Pagan lady feel the insufficiency of earthly
things for happiness? No; because any feeling tending
in that direction would be to her, as to all around her,
simply a diseased feeling, whether from dyspepsia or
hypochondria, and one, whether diseased or not, worthless
for practical purposes. It would have to be a
Christian lady, if something far beyond, something infinite,
were not connected with it, depending on it. But
if this were by you ascribed to the Pagan lady, then
<i>that</i> is in other words to make her a Christian lady
already.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Exhibition of a Roman Dialogue on Sin.</i>&mdash;What! says
the ignorant and unreflecting modern Christian. Do you
mean to tell me that a Roman, however buried in worldly
objects, would not be startled at hearing of a Saviour?
Now, hearken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Saviour! What do you mean? Saviour for
what? In good faith, my friend, you labour under some
misconception. I am used to rely on myself for all
the saving that I need. And, generally speaking, if you
except the sea, and those cursed north-east winds, I
know of no particular danger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian.</span> Oh, my friend, you totally mistake the
matter. I mean saving from sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Saving from a fault, that is&mdash;well, what sort
of a fault? Or, how should a man, that you say is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
longer on earth, save me from any fault? Is it a book
to warn me of faults that He has left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian.</span> Why, yes. Not that He wrote Himself;
but He talked, and His followers have recorded His
views. But still you are quite in the dark. Not faults,
but the fountain of all faults, that is what He will save
you from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman.</span> But how? I can understand that by illuminating
my judgment in general He might succeed in
making me more prudent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian.</span> 'Judgment,' 'prudent'&mdash;these words show
how wide by a whole hemisphere you are of the truth.
It is your will that He applies His correction to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman.</span> 'Will!' why I've none but peaceable and
lawful designs, I assure you. Oh! I begin to see. You
think me a partner with those pirates that we just
spoke to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian.</span> Not at all, my friend. I speak not of
designs or intentions. What I mean is, the source of all
desires&mdash;what I would call your wills, your whole moral
nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman</span> (<i>bridling</i>). Ahem! I hope Roman nature is
quite as little in need of improvement as any other.
There are the Cretans; they held up their heads.
Accordingly they had their fire institutions, and that
true institution against bribery and luxury, and all such
stuff. They fancied themselves impregnable. Why,
bless you! even Marcus Tullius, that was a prosing kind
of man and rather peevish about such things, could not
keep in the truth. 'Why, Cato, my boy,' says he, 'you
talk.' And to hear you, bribery and luxury would not
leave one a stick to fight for. Why, now, these same
Cretans&mdash;lord! we took the conceit out of them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
twenty-five minutes. No more time, I assure you, did it
cost three of our cohorts to settle the whole lot of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian.</span> My friend, you are more and more in the
dark. What I mean is not present in your senses, but a
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Oh, a disease! that's another thing. But
where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian.</span> Why, it affects the brain and the heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Well, now, one at a time. Take the brain&mdash;we
have a disease, and we treat it with white hellebore.
There may be a better way. But answer me this. If
you are generally affected, what right have you to bring,
as you are supposing, a diseased brain to a sound one?
We Romans are all sound&mdash;sound as a bell.</p>

<p>Then Christian goes on to the history of the fall. But
the whole would be self-baffled and construed away from
want of sin as the antithesis of holiness.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Why St. Paul and the Athenians did not come to an
Understanding.</i>&mdash;So, again, if you think that St. Paul
had a chance with the Athenians. If he had, it would
tax his divine benevolence to see that he forbore to
pursue it. This attempt shows that he was under a
misconception. He fancied a possibility of preaching a
pure religion. What followed? He was, he must have
been defeated. That is, practically, else why did he not
persist? But his confutation was the factual confutation
of experience. It was no go. That he found too surely.
But why? I am sure that he never found out. Enough
that he felt&mdash;that under a strong instinct he misgave&mdash;a
deep, deep gulf between him and them, so that neither
could he make a way to their sense, nor they, except
conjecturally, to his. For, just review the case. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
was the <ins class="mycorr" title="euangelion">&#949;&#965;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</ins>, the good tidings, which he announced
to man? What burthen of hope? What revelation of
a mystery of hope arising out of a deeper mystery of
despair? He announced a deliverer. Deliverer! from
what? Answer that&mdash;from what? Why, from evil,
you say. Evil! of what kind? Why, you retort, did
not the Pagans admit that man was lying under evil?
Not at all; nothing of the kind. But you are sure you
have heard of such things? Very likely. And now you
are forced back upon your arguments you remember
specially that evil as to its origin was a favourite speculation
of theirs. Evil, in its most comprehensive designation,
whence is it? How came it? Now, mark, even to
that extent, viz., the extent indicated by this problem,
the ancients had no conception of evil corresponding to,
no, nor dimly approaching to, a correspondence with
ours. They had no ineffable standard of purity; how,
then, any function of impurity? They had no ineffable
doctrine of pain or suffering answering to a far more
realized state of perception, and, therefore, unimaginably
more exquisite; how, then, could they raise a question
on the nature or fountains of such pains? They executed
no synthesis, and could execute none upon the calamities
of life; they never said in ordinary talk that this was a
world of sorrow, either apostrophizing a newborn child,
or a world of disappointment, bemoaning a mature
victim; neither as in the anguish of meditative reflection,
nor in the prudence of extenuating apology. The
grand <i>sanctus</i> which arises from human sensibility,
Perish empires and the crowns of kings, etc., first arose
in connection with Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Life was a good life;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>man was a prosperous being. Hope for men was his
natural air; despondency the element of his own self-created
folly. Neither could it be otherwise. For, besides
that, it would be too immeasurable a draught of
woe to say in one breath that this only was the crux or
affirmation of man's fate, and yet that this also was
wretched <i>per se</i>; not accidentally made wretched by
imprudence, but essentially and irrevocably so by necessity
of its nature. Besides all this, which has a lurking
dependency upon man's calculations of what is safe, he
sees that this mode of thinking would leave him nothing;
yet even that extreme consequence would not check
some honest or sincere or desperate minds from uttering
their convictions that life really <i>was</i> this desperate game<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>&mdash;much
to lose and nothing in the best case to win.
So far there would have been a dangerous gravitation
at all times to the sad conclusion of Paganism. But,
meanwhile, this dangerous gravitation was too dangerous,
and Providence has deeply counteracted it by principles
laid down in human nature. I affirm that where
the ideas of man, where the possible infinities are not
developed, then also the exorbitant on the other field is
strongly pulled up. No ideals of evil can take place
except under ideals of happiness that passeth all understanding.
No synthesis can ever be executed, that is, no
annumeration of A, B, C into a common total, viewed as
elements tending to a common unity, unless previously
this unity has been preconceived, because the elements
are not elements, viz., original constituents of a representative
whole (a series tending to a summation), unless
that which is constituted&mdash;that whole&mdash;is previously
given in idea. Since A and B and C could not be viewed
as tending to a unity, having no existence except through
them, unless previously that unity had existed for the
regulation and eduction of its component elements. And
this unity in the case of misery never could have been
given unless far higher functions than any which could
endure Paganism, or which Paganism could endure.
Until the sad element of a diseased will is introduced,
until the affecting notion is developed of a fountain in
man himself welling up the misery for ever, no idea
of misery could arise. Suffering is limited and transitory.
What pain is permanent in man? Even the deepest
laceration of the human heart, that which is inflicted by
the loss of those who were the pulses of our hearts,
is soothed (if never wholly healed) by time. One agency
of time would avail for this effect were there no other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
The features of the individual whom we mourn grow
dimmer and dimmer as time advances; and, <i>pari passu</i>,
the features of places and collateral objects and associated
persons from whom reverberated these afflicting reminiscences
of the lost object.</p>

<p>I return: Deliverer from what? From suffering or
misery. But that was not acknowledged, nor could have
been, we could see no misery as a hypothesis except in
these two modes: First, as a radication in man by means
of something else, some third thing. Secondly, as a
synthesis&mdash;as a gathering under a principle which must
act prior to the gathering in order to provoke it. (The
synthesis must be rendered possible and challenged by
the <i>&agrave; priori</i> unity which otherwise constitutes that unity.)
As a metaphysical possibility evil was recognised through
its unfathomable nature. But this was because such a
nature already presupposed a God's nature, realizing his
own ends, stepped in with effect. For the highest form&mdash;the
normal or transcendent form&mdash;of virtue to a Pagan,
was in the character of citizen. Indeed, the one sole or
affirmative form of virtue lay in this sole function, viz., of
public, of patriotic virtue. Since here only it was possible
to introduce an <i>additional</i> good to the world. All other
virtue, as of justice between individual and individual,
did but redress a previous error, sometimes of the man
himself, sometimes of social arrangement, sometimes of
accident. It was a <i>plus</i> which balanced and compensated
a pre-existing <i>minus</i>&mdash;an action <i>in regressu</i>, which
came back with prevailing power upon an action <i>in progressu.</i>
But to be a patriot was to fulfil a call of the
supererogatory heart&mdash;a great nisus of sympathy with the
one sole infinite, the sole practical infinite that man pre-Christian
ever could generate for his contemplation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Now, therefore, it followed that the idea of virtue here
only found its realization. Virtue, in fact, was not derivatively
or consequentially connected with patriotism,
it was <i>immanent</i>; not transitively associated by any links
whatever, but immanently intertwisted, indwelling in the
idea. Therefore it happened that a man, however heartsick
of this tumid, bladdery delusion, although to him it
was a balloon, by science punctured, lacerated, collapsing,
trailed through ditch and mud under the rough handling
and the fearful realities of life, yet he durst not avow his
private feelings. That would have been even worse than
with us: it would have been to proclaim virtue and vice
mere bubbles and chimeras. He who really thinks so
even we reasonably suspect of <i>practical</i> indifference unless
when we believe him to speak as a misanthrope.</p>

<p>The question suppose to commence as to the divine
mission of Christ. And the feeble understanding is sure
to think this will be proved best by proving the subject
of this doubt to have been a miracle-working power. And
of all miracles, to have mastered (not merely escaped or
evaded) death will be in his opinion the greatest. So
that if Christ could be proved to have absolutely conquered
death, <i>i.e.</i>, to have submitted to death, but only
to recoil from his power and overthrow it, to have died
and subsequently to have risen again, will, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>,
prove Him to have been sent of God.</p>

<p>Not so. All and every basis of credibility must be laid
in the <i>moral</i> nature, where the thing to be believed is
important, <i>i.e.</i>, moral. And I therefore open with this
remark absolutely <i>zermalmende</i> to the common intellect:
That from a holy faith you may infer a power of resurrection,
but not from a power of resurrection fifty times repeated
can we infer a holy faith. What in the last result<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
is the thing to be proved? Why, a holy revelation, not
of knowledge, but of things practical; of agenda, not
scienda. It is essential that this holy should also be <i>new</i>,
<i>original</i>, <i>revelatum.</i> Because, else, the divinest things
which are <i>connata</i> and have been common to all men,
point to no certain author. They belong to the dark
foundations of our being, and cannot challenge a trust,
faith, or expectation as suspended upon any particular
individual man whatever.</p>

<p>Here, then, arises the <ins class="mycorr" title="pr&ocirc;tontokinon">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;</ins>. Thick darkness
sits on every man's mind as to Christ's revelation. He
fancies that it amounts to this: 'Do what is good. Do
your duty. Be good.' And with this vague notion of the
doctrine, natural is it that he should think it as old as
the hills. The first step to a saner view is, to understand&mdash;if
a man has sense enough to reach so high&mdash;that the
subtlest discoveries ever made by man, all put together,
do not make one wave of that Atlantic as to novelty and
originality which lies in the moral scheme of Christianity.
I do not mean in the total scheme of Christianity, redemption,
etc. No, but in the ethics.</p>

<p>All ethics that ever Greece refined or Rome illustrated,
was, and could be, only the same universal system of
social ethics&mdash;ethics proper and exclusive to man and
man <i>inter se</i>, with no glimpse of any upward relationship.</p>

<p>Now Christianity looks upward for the first time.
This in the first place. Secondly, out of that upward
look Christianity looks secondarily down again, and
reacts even upon the social ethics in the most tremendous
way.</p>

<br />
<p><i>For my Book on the Relations of Christianity to Man.</i>&mdash;S.
T. C. cites Jeremy Taylor, etc., for horrible passages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
on the gloomy state of the chances for virtuous Pagans.
S. T. C. in a more liberal generation is shocked; and of
course in his readers as in himself secretly, he professes
more liberal ideas. Aye, but how is he entitled to these
ideas? For, on further consideration, it is not Cicero
only, or Epictetus only, that would suffer under this law
of Christianity viewed in its reagency, but also Abraham,
David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Hezekiah. Because, how could
they benefit by a Redeemer not yet revealed&mdash;nay, by a
Redeemer not even existing? For it is not the second
person in the Trinity&mdash;not He separately and abstractedly&mdash;that
is the Redeemer, but that second person incarnated.
St. Paul apparently wished to smuggle this tremendous
question into a fraudulent solution, by mixing up Abraham
(with others pre-Christian and Christian) into the long
array of those whose <i>Faith</i> had saved them. But faith
in whom? General faith in God is not the thing, it is
faith in Jesus Christ; and we are solemnly told in many
shapes that no other name was given on earth through
which men could be delivered. Indeed, if not, how is
the Messiah of such exclusive and paramount importance
to man? The Messiah was as yet (viz., in Abraham's
time) a prophecy&mdash;a dim, prophetic outline of one who
<i>should</i> be revealed. But if Abraham and many others
could do without Him, if this was a dispensable idea, how
was it in any case, first or last, indispensable? Besides,
recur to the theory of Christianity. Most undeniably it
was this, that neither of the two elements interested in
man could save him; not God; He might have power,
but His purity revolted. Power (or doubtfully so), but
no will. Not man&mdash;for he, having the will, had no power.
God was too holy; manhood too <i>un</i>holy. Man's gifts,
applicable, but insufficient. God's sufficient, but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>applicable.
Then came the compromise. How if man
could be engrafted upon God? Thus only, and by such
a synthesis, could the ineffable qualities of God be so co-ordinated
with those of man.</p>

<br />
<p>Suppose even that a verbal inspiration could have
been secured&mdash;secured, observe, against <i>gradual</i> changes
in language and against the reactionary corruption of
concurrent versions, which it would be impossible to
guarantee as also enjoying such an inspiration (since,
in that case, <i>what</i> barrier would divide mine or anybody's
wilfully false translations from that pretending to
authority? I repeat <i>what</i>? None is conceivable, since
what could you have beyond the assurance of the
translator, even which could only guarantee his intentions)&mdash;here
is a cause of misinterpretation amounting
to ruin, viz., after being read for centuries as if
practically meant for our guidance, such and such a
chapter (<i>e.g.</i>, Jael and Sisera), long proscribed by the
noble as a record of abominable perfidy, has at length
been justified on the ground that it was never meant
for anything else. Thus we might get rid of David, etc.,
were it not that for his flexible obedience to the <i>clerus</i>
he has been pronounced the man after God's own heart.</p>

<p>Is it not dreadful that at the very vestibule of any
attempt to execute the pretended law of God and its
sentences to hell we are interrupted by one case in
every three as exceptional? Of the deaths, one in three
are of children under five. Add to these surely <i>very</i>
many up to twelve or thirteen, and <i>many</i> up to eighteen
or twenty, then you have a law which suspends itself
for one case in every two.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span><i>Note in the argument drawn from perishableness of
language.</i> Not only (which I have noted) is any
language, <i>ergo</i> the original, Chald&aelig;an, Greek, etc.,
perishable even for those who use it, but also the vast
openings to error which all languages open to translators
form a separate source of error in translators, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The old one on my list that for them the guidance
of inspiration has ceased, else, if not, you must set
up an inspiration separately to translators, since, if you
say&mdash;No, not at all, why, which then?</p>

<p>2. The uncertainty of a foreign language even in a
day contemporary with the original writer, and therefore
over and above what arises from lapse of time and
gradual alterations.</p>

<br />
<p><i>On Human Progress.</i>&mdash;Oftentimes it strikes us all that
this is so insensible as to elude observation the very
nicest. Five years add nothing, we fancy. Now invert
your glass. In 1642 Englishmen are fighting for great
abstract principles. In 1460-83 (<i>i.e.</i>, 100 + 17 + 42 years
before, or 159 years) they are fighting for persons, for
rival candidates. In 1460 they could not have conceived
more than an Esquimaux can entertain a question about
the constitution of lyric poetry, or the differential
principles of English and Greek tragedy, the barest
approximation to questions that in 1642 are grounds of
furious quarrel, of bloody quarrel, of extermination.
Now then, looking forward, you would see from year to
year little if any growth; but inverting your glass,
looking back from the station of 1642 to 1460, you see a
progress that if subdivided amongst all the 159 years
would give to each <i>x</i>/0 as its quota, <i>i.e.</i> infinity. In fact,
it is like the progression from nothing to something. It
is&mdash;creation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>All the body of the Christian world would fly out in a
rage if you should say that Christianity required of you
many things that were easy, but one thing that was
<i>not.</i> Yet this is undoubtedly true; it requires you to
<i>believe</i>, and even in the case where you know what it is
to believe, and so far are free from perplexity, you have
it not in your own power to ensure (though you can influence
greatly) your own power to believe. But also
great doubt for many (and for all that are not somewhat
metaphysical) attends the knowledge of what is believing.</p>

<br />
<p>As to my mother's fancy that Sir W. Jones had found in
the East proofs of Christianity, having gone out an infidel.</p>

<p>To do her justice, never once after she had adopted a
theory of Christianity did she inquire or feel anxious
about its proof. But to review the folly of this idea.</p>

<p>1. That Christianity there where it reigned and was
meant to reign should be insufficient in its proofs; but that
in a far distant land, lurking in some hole or corner,
there should be proofs of its truth, just precisely where
these proofs were not wanted. And again, that these should
be reserved for one scholar rambling into a solitary path,
where in a moral sense <i>nobody</i> could follow him (for it <i>is</i>
nobody&mdash;this or that oriental scholar). And we are sure
that his proof was not of that order to shine by its own
light, else it would have resounded through England.</p>

<p>2. That for many hundreds of years Christianity should
have been received, generation after generation should
have lived under its vital action, upon no sufficient
argument, and suddenly such an argument should turn
up as a reward to a man in a country not Christian
for being more incredulous than his neighbours; how
impossible!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>That fraudulent argument which affects to view the
hardships of an adventurous life and its perils as capable
of one sole impression&mdash;that of repulsion&mdash;and secondly
as the sole circumstances about such adventures, injures
from the moment when it is perceived: not</p>

<p>1. The writer only; no matter for him, worthless liar,
how much he sinks in the opinion of his readers: but</p>

<p>2. The Apostles. Now see the injury of falsehood.
Suddenly it snaps, and with a great reaction causes a jar
to the whole system, which in ordinary minds it is never
likely to recover. The reason it is not oftener perceived
is that people read such books in a somnolent, inactive
state of mind, one-tenth coming to a subject on which
they have already made up their minds, and open to no
fresh impressions, the other nine-tenths caring not
one straw about the matter, as reading it in an age of
irreflectiveness and purely through an act of obedience
to their superiors, else not only does this hypocritical
attempt to varnish give way all at once, and suddenly
(with an occasion ever after of doubt, and causing a
reflection to any self-sufficient man, suddenly coming
to perceive that he has been cheated, and with some
justification for jealousy thenceforwards to the maker
up of a case), but also it robs the Apostles of the human
grace they really possessed. For if we suppose them
armed against all temptations, snares, seductions, by
a supernatural system of endowments, this is but the
case of an angel&mdash;nay, not of an angel, for it is probable
that when an angel incarnated himself, or one of the
Pagan deities, who was obliged first to incarnate himself
before he could act amongst men, or so much as be seen
by men, he was bound by all the defects of man, <i>i.e.</i>,
he could choose only an ideal, so far ideal as to elude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the worst effects from vice, intemperance, etc. The
angel who wrestled with Jacob probably did his best;
he was a stout fellow, but so was the patriarch. The
very condition of incarnation, and this because the mere
external form already includes limitations (as of a fish,
not to fly; of a man, not to fly, etc.) probably includes
as a <i>necessity</i>, not as a choice, the adoption of all evils
connected with the nature assumed. Even the Son of
God, once incarnated, was not exempted from any evil
of flesh; He grew, passed through the peculiar infirmities
of every stage up to mature life; would have grown old,
infirm, weak, had He lived longer; was liable to death,
the worst of all human evils, and was not, we may be
sure, exempted from any one fleshly desire with regard
to sex, or enemies, or companions, but because that
divine principle, which also <i>is in man</i>, yes, in every man
the foulest and basest&mdash;this light which the darkness
comprehended not, and which in some is early extinguished,
but in <i>all</i> fights fitfully with the winds and
storms of this human atmosphere, in Him was raised to
a lustre unspeakable by His pure and holy will.</p>

<p>If the Apostles were more celestially armed in any
other sense than as we are all armed from above by
calling forth our better natures, if in any other sense
than as sorrow arms us by purifying our natures, as
sorrowful reflection, as meditation and earnest endeavours
to resist our angry instincts (which, on the contrary, how
often do men <i>obey</i> under the vile pretence of being put
by conscience on a painful duty), then, I say, what were
the Apostles to us? Why should we admire them? How
can we make them models of imitation? It is like that
case of Anarcharsis the Scythian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p>It does certainly incense a Christian to think that
stupid Mahommedans should impute to us such <i>childish</i>
idolatries as that of God having a son and heir&mdash;just as
though we were barbarous enough to believe that God
was liable to old age&mdash;that the time was coming, however
distant, when somebody would say to him, 'Come, Sir,'
or 'Come, my Lord, really you are not what you were.
It's time you gave yourself some ease (<ins class="mycorr" title="euph&ecirc;mi">&#949;&#965;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#953;</ins>, time, indeed,
that you resigned the powers to which you are
unequal), and let a younger man take the reins.' None
but a filthy barbarian could carry forward his thoughts
so little as not to see that this son in due time would find
himself in the same predicament.</p>

<p>Now mark how Christian lands would enforce this
doctrine of unity by horrid coercions. They hang,
drown, burn, crucify those who deny it. So that, be
assured you are planting your corner-stone on the
most windy of delusions. You yourselves do not ascribe
any merit to Mahommed separate from that of revealing
the unity of God. Consequently, if that is a shaken
craze arising from mere inability on his part, a little, a
very little information would have cut up by the very
roots the whole peculiarity of Islam. For if a wise man
could have assembled these conceited Arabians and told
them: Great thieves, you fancy yourselves to have shot
far ahead of the Christians as to the point of unity, and
if you had I would grant that you had made a prodigious
advance. But you are deceiving quarrellers. It is all a
word&mdash;mere smoke, that blinds you. The Christian
seems to affirm three Gods, and even to aggravate this
wickedness by calling one of them 'a Son,' thus seeming
to accept that monstrous notion that God is liable to old
age and decrepitude, so as to provide wisely against His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
own dotage. But all this is an error: these three apparent
Gods are but one, and in the most absolute sense
one.</p>

<br />
<p>The most shockingly searching, influential, and permanent
blunder that ever has affected the mind of man
has been the fancy that a religion includes a creed as to
its <ins class="mycorr" title="aporrh&ecirc;ta">&#945;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#8165;&#951;&#964;&#945;</ins>, and a morality; in short, that it was doctrinal
by necessity, enactory, and (which has been the
practical part of the blunder) therefore exclusive,
because:</p>

<p>1. With our notion of a religion as essentially doctrinal,
the very first axiom about it is, that being true
itself it makes all others false. Whereas, the capital
distinction of the Pagan was&mdash;that given, supposing to
be assumed, 10,000 religions&mdash;all must be true simultaneously,
all equally. When a religion includes any distinct
propositions offered to the understanding (that is, I
think, resting upon a principle or tendency to a consequence
by way of differencing from facts which also
are for the understanding, but then barely to contemplate
not with a power of reacting on the understanding,
for every principle introduces into the mind that which
may become a modification, a restraint; whereas, a fact
restrains nothing in the way of thought unless it includes
a principle), it would rise continually in its exclusive
power according to the number of those propositions.
At first it might exclude all but ten, eight, seven, and so
on; finally, as integrated it would exclude all.</p>

<p>2. If you ask on what principle a Pagan believed his
religion, the question to him was almost amusing and
laughable. I will illustrate the case. A man meets you
who inquires in a hurried, suppose even in an agitated way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
whether you met a tall man, blind of one eye, dressed in
such a coloured dress, etc. Now, does it ever occur to
you that the inquirer is lying? Lying! Wherefore
should he lie? Or again, if you say that your house
stands under a hill, that three out of four chimneys
smoke, and that you must indeed try some of the inventions
for remedying this annoyance, would any man
in his senses think of speculating on the possibility that
all this should be a romance? Or, to come nearer in the
kind of fact, if a man represented his family fortune as
having been bequeathed by a maiden aunt in the last
generation, would any man say otherwise than that
doubtless the man knew his own benefactors and relatives
best? On this same principle, when Christ was
mentioned as the divinity adored by a certain part of the
Jews who were by way of distinction called Christians, why
should a Roman object? What motive could he have for
denying the existence or the divine existence of Christ?
Even the idea of dissent or schism, some Jews worshipping,
some protesting, would not much puzzle him. Something
like it had occurred in Pagan lands. Neptune and Athene
had contended for Attica. And under the slight inquiry
which he would ever make, or listen to when made by
others, he might wonder at the rancour displayed by the
protesting party, but he would take it for granted that a
divinity of some local section had been unduly pushed
into pre-eminence over a more strictly epichorial divinity.
He would go off with this notion, that whereas, the
elder Jews insisted on paying vows, etc., to a God called
Jehovah, a section sought to transfer that allegiance to a
divinity called Christ. If he were further pressed on the
subject, he would fancy that very possibly, as had been
thought, found or imagined in the case of Syrian deities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
or Egyptian, etc., that perhaps Christ might correspond
to Apollo, as Astarte to Diana, Neptune of Latium to
the Poseid&ocirc;n of Greece. But if not, that would cause
no scruple at all. Thus far it was by possibility a mere
affair of verbal difference. But suppose it ascertained
that in no point of the symbols surrounding the worship
of Christ, or the conception of His person, He could
be identified with any previously-known Pagan God&mdash;that
would only introduce Him into the matricula of
Gods as a positive novelty. Nor would it have startled
a Roman to hear that in India or any country large enough
there should be a separate Pantheon of many thousand
deities, <i>plus</i> some other Pantheon of divinities corresponding
to their own. For Syria&mdash;but still more in one
section of Syrian Palestine&mdash;this would surprise him
<i>quoad</i> the degree, not <i>quoad</i> the principle. The Jew
had a separate or peculiar God, why not? No nation
could exist without Gods: the very separate existence of
a people, trivial as it might be in power and wealth,
argued a tutelary God, but, of course, proportioned to
the destinies at least (and in part to the present size) of
the country. Thus far no difficulties at all. But the
morality! Aye, but that would never be accounted a
part of religion. As well confound a science with religion.
Aye, but the <ins class="mycorr" title="aporrh&ecirc;ta">&#945;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#8165;&#951;&#964;&#945;</ins>. These would be viewed
as the rites of Adonis, or of Ceres; you could not warn
him from his preconception that these concerned only
Jews. Where, therefore, lodged the offence? Why
here, as personalities&mdash;for such merely were all religions&mdash;the
God must be measured by his nation. So some
Romans proposed to introduce Christ into the Roman
Pantheon. But what first exploded as a civil offence
was the demand of supremacy and the inconceivable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
principle set up of incompatibility. This was mere
folly.</p>

<br />
<p>A much more solemn, significant and prophetic meaning
than the common one may be secured to the famous
passage in St. Matthew&mdash;'And thou shalt call His
name <i>Jesus.</i>' This injunction wears the most impressive
character belonging to heavenly adjuration, when
it is thus confided to the care and custody of a special
angel, and in the very hour of inauguration, and amongst
the very birth-throes of Christianity. For in two separate
modes the attention is secretly pointed and solicited to
the grand serpentine artifice, which met and confronted
the almost insurmountable difficulty besetting Christianity
on its very threshold: First, by the record of the early
<i>therapeutic</i> miracles, since in that way only, viz., by a
science of healing, which the philosopher equally with
the populace recognised as resting upon inspiration from
God, could the magistrate and civil authority have been
steadily propitiated; secondly, by the very verbal suggestion
couched in the name <i>Jesus</i>, or <i>Healer.</i> At the
most critical of moments an angel reveals himself, for
the purpose of saying '<i>Thou shalt call His name Jesus</i>'&mdash;and
why Jesus? Because, says the angel, 'He shall
heal or cleanse His people from sin as from a bodily
disease.' Thus, in one and the same moment is suggested
prospectively to the early Christian, who is
looking forward in search of some adequate protection
against the civil magistrate, and theoretically and retrospectively
is suggested to the Christian of our own
philosophizing days, that admirable resource of what
by a shorthand expression I will call <i>Hakimism.</i> The
<i>Hakim</i>, the <i>Jesus</i>, the <i>Healer</i>, comes from God. Mobs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
must not be tolerated. But neither must the deep
therapeutic inspirations of God be made of none effect,
or narrowed in their applications. And thus in one
moment was the panic from disease armed against the
panic from insurgent mobs; the privileged Hakim was
marshalled against the privileged magistrate; and the
deep superstition, which saw, and not unreasonably, a
demon raging in a lawless mob, saw also a demon not
less blind or cruel in the pestilence that walked in darkness.
And, as one magnet creates other magnets, so
also the Hakim, once privileged, could secretly privilege
others. And the physical Hakim could by no test or
shibboleth be prevented from silently introducing the
spiritual Hakim. And thus, whilst thrones and councils
were tumultuating in panic, behold! suddenly the
Christian soldier was revealed amongst them as an
armed man.</p>

<br />
<p>'<i>&Eacute;crasez l'inf&acirc;me</i>,' I also say: and who is he? It
would be mere insanity to suppose that it could be <i>any</i>
teacher of moral truths. Even I, who so much despise
Socrates, could not reasonably call him <i>l'inf&acirc;me.</i></p>

<p>But who, then, is <i>l'inf&acirc;me</i>? It is he who, finding in
those great ideas which I have noticed as revelations
from God, and which throw open to the startled heart
the heaven of heavens, in the purity, the holiness, the
peace which passeth all understanding, finding no argument
of divinity, then afterwards <i>does</i> find it in the little
tricks of legerdemain, in conjuring, in pr&aelig;stigia. But
here, though perhaps roused a little to see the baseness
of relying on these miracles, and also in the rear a far
worse argument against them, he still feels uncomfortable
at such words applied to things which Christ did. Christ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
could not make, nor wished to make, that great which
was inherently mean; that relevant, which was originally
irrelevant. If He did things in themselves mean, it was
because He suited Himself to mean minds, incapable of
higher views; wretches such as exist amongst us of
modern days by millions, on whom all His Divine words
were thrown away, wretches deaf and blind and besotted,
to whom it was said in vain: 'He that looketh upon a
woman,' and what follows, creating by a rod of divinity
in man's heart a far superior ideal of the moral; who
heard with indifference His 'Bless those who persecute
you;' yes, listened unmoved to His 'Suffer little children
to come unto Me;' who heard with anger His 'In heaven
there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage;' who
abhorred His great doctrine that the counsels of God
were not read in the events of things<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; who slighted as
trivial that prayer which a wise man might study with
profit for a thousand years; beasts, wretches, that
turned away deaf and blind, even as their sons turn
away, from these arguments of a truth far transcending
all that yet had come amongst men; but whilst trampling
with their brutal hoofs upon such flowers of Paradise,
turned in stupid wonderment to some mere legerdemain
or jugglery.</p>

<br />
<p><i>The Truth.</i>&mdash;But what tongue can express, what scale
can measure, the awful change in man's relations to the
unseen world? Where there had been a blank not filled
by anything, not by any smoke or dusky tarnish of suspicion,
not filled by so much as any shadowy outline or
vague phantom of possibility, <i>there</i> was now seen rising,
'like Teneriffe or Atlas'&mdash;say rather, by symbolizing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>the greatest of human interests by the greatest of human
visual objects, like the snowy peaks of the Himalaya,
peaks that by men's feelings are referred to the heavens
rather than to the earth; to the beings 'whose dwelling
is no thick flesh,' rather than to men who have in no
age succeeded in scaling them; and who in their steps
to those mighty thrones have heard nothing but dread
crashes of sound&mdash;again to fade or vanish, the colossal
form, never the mighty idea of 'The Truth.'<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Where
there had been nothing, a blank, a chasm, there stood
in solemn proportions a new object for man, called The
Truth. Why was it called <i>The</i> Truth? How could
such an idea arise? Many persons will be weak enough
to fancy that, as <ins class="mycorr" title="hopo&ecirc;t&ecirc;s">&#8001;&#960;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#951;&#962;</ins> was sometimes an artifice of
rhetoric for expressing the exclusive supremacy of
Homer, and as by a pure affectation and movement of
dissimulation a man was called by the title of <i>The Orator</i>,
his own favourite Greek or Roman thus affecting for the
moment to know of no other (for all such emphatic and
exclusive uses of <i>the</i> imply a momentary annihilation
of the competitors, as though in comparison of the ideal
exemplification these minor and approximating forms
had no existence&mdash;or at least, not <i>quoad hunc locum</i>&mdash;as
'the mountain in Sicily' would rightly indicate Etna),
on the same artificial principle they may imagine rhetoricians
to have denominated (or if not, to have had it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>their power to denominate) some one department of
truth which they wished to favour as <i>the</i> truth. But
this conventional denomination would not avail, and for
two reasons: First, that rival modes of truth (physics
against mathematics, rhetoric against music) would contest
the title, and no such denomination would have a basis
of any but a sort of courtesy or vicarious harmonious
reality from the very first. Secondly, that, standing
in no relation whatever to God, every mode, form,
division or subdivision of truth merely intellectual
would gain nothing at all by such ostentatious arts.
Algebra has been distinguished by glorious names; so
has the fancied knowledge of transmutation applied to
the metals; so, doubtless, has many a visionary speculation
of magic; so, again, has the ridiculous schwermerey
of the Rabbis in particular ages. But those are as transient
and even for the moment as partial titles as the
titles of Invincible or Seraphic applied to scholastic
divines. Out of this idea the truth grew, next (suppose
<i>x</i>) another <i>Martyrdom.</i></p>

<p>The difference between all human doctrines and this is
as between a marble statue and a quick thing. The
statue may be better, and it may be of better material;
it may be of ivory, of marble, and amongst marbles
known to the ancient sculptors of several different kinds
the most prized; of silver gilt, of hollow gold, of massy
gold, and in all degrees of skill; but still one condition
applies to all&mdash;whatever the material, whoever the artist,
the statue is inanimate, the breath of life is not within
its nostrils. Motion, spontaneity, action and antagonist
action, the subtle watch-work of the brain, the mighty
laboratory of the heart, vision, sensibility, self-propagated
warmth, pleasure, hope, memory, thought, liberty&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
one of these divine gifts does it possess. It is cold, icy,
senseless, dull, inert matter. Let Phidias have formed
the statue, it is no better. Let the purest gold be its
material, it is no worthier than the meanest model in
clay to the valuation of the philosopher. And here, as
in so many cases, the great philosopher meets with the
labouring man; both meet with the little innocent child.
All have the same undervaluation of the statue. And if
any man values it preposterously, it will be neither a
great philosopher, nor a labouring man with horny fists,
nor a little innocent and natural child. It will be some
crazy simpleton, who dignifies himself as a man of taste,
as <i>elegans formarum spectator</i>, as one having a judicious
eye for the distinctions of form. But now, suddenly, let
one of the meanest of these statues begin to stir and
shiver with the mystery of life, let it be announced that
something 'quick' is in the form, let the creeping of life,
the suffusion of sensibility, the awful sense of responsibility
and accountability ripen themselves, what a shock&mdash;what
a panic! What an interest&mdash;how profound&mdash;would
diffuse itself in every channel. Such is the ethics
of God as contrasted with the ethics of Greek philosophers.
The only great thing ever done by Greece or
by Greek philosophers was the ethics. Yet, after all,
these were but integrations of the natural ethics implanted
in each man's heart. Integrations they were,
but rearrangements&mdash;redevelopments from some common
source.</p>

<br />
<p>It is remarkable that the Scriptures, valuing clearness
and fencing against misunderstandings above all things,
never suspend&mdash;there is no <ins class="mycorr" title="epoch&ecirc;">&#949;&#960;&#959;&#967;&#951;</ins> in the scriptural style
of the early books. And, therefore, when I first came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
a text, 'If when,' I was thunderstruck, and I found that
this belongs to the more cultivated age of Hebrew
literature.</p>

<br />
<p>'<i>And the swine because it divideth the hoof, yet
cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you</i>' (Deut.
xiv. 8). Now the obvious meaning is, <i>prim&acirc; facie</i>, that
the ground of its uncleanness was its dividing the hoof.
Whereas, so far from this, to divide the hoof is a ground
of cleanness. It is a fact, a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>&mdash;that is, a
negative condition of cleanness; but not, therefore,
taken singly the affirmative or efficient cause of cleanness.
It must in addition to this chew the cud&mdash;it must
ruminate. Which, again, was but a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>&mdash;that
is, a negative condition, indispensable, indeed; whose
absence could not be tolerated in any case, but whose
presence did not therefore, and as a matter of course,
avail anything. For the reverse case occurred in the
camel, hare, and rabbit. They <i>do</i> chew the cud, the
absence of which habit caused the swine to be rejected,
but then they 'divide not the hoof.' Accordingly they
were equally rejected as food with the swine.</p>

<br />
<p>We see the great Jewish lawgiver looking forward to
cases which actually occurred nearly five hundred years
after, as demanding a king, and again looking still
farther to cases eight hundred and a thousand years
after&mdash;their disobedience and rebellion to God. Now,
many will think that it must have been an easy thing for
any people, when swerving from their law, and especially
in that one great fundamental article of idolatry as the
Jews so continually did, and so naturally when the
case is examined, to always have an easy retreat: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
plagues and curses denounced would begin to unfold
themselves, and then what more easy than to relinquish
the idolatrous rites or customs, resuming with their old
rituals to God their old privileges? But this was
doubly impossible. First, because men utterly misconceive
the matter when they suppose that with direct
consecutive succession the judgment would succeed the
trespass. Large tracts of time would intervene. Else
such direct clockwork as sin and punishment, repentance
and relief, would dishonour God not less than they would
trivialize the people. God they would offend by defeating
all His purposes; the people they would render vile
by ripening into mechanic dissimulation. The wrath of
God slept often for a long season; He saw as one who
saw not. And by the time that His large councils had
overtaken them, and His judgments were fast coming up
with the offenders, they had so hardened themselves in
error that a whole growth of false desires had sprung up,
and of false beliefs, blind maxims, bad habits, bad connections,
and proverbs, which found out a reconciliation
of that irreconcilable truth with the foulest pollutions.
The victims of temptation had become slow even to
suspect their own condition. And, if some more enlightened
did so, the road of existence was no longer easy.
Error had woven chains about them. They were enmeshed.
And it is but a faint emblem of their situation to
say, that as well may a man commence a habit of intoxication
for the purpose of having five years' pleasure, and
then halting in his career, as the Jews may contaminate
themselves tentatively with idolatrous connections under
the delusion that it would always be time enough for
untreading their steps when these connections had begun
to produce evil. For they could not recover the station<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
from which they swerved. They that had now realized
the <i>casus f&#339;deris</i>, the case in which they had covenanted
themselves to desist from idolatry, were no longer the
men who had made that covenant. They had changed
profoundly and imperceptibly. So that the very vision
of truth was overcast with carnal doubts; the truth
itself had retired to a vast distance and shone but feebly
for them, and the very will was palsied in its motions of
recovery.</p>

<p>In such a state, suppose it confirmed and now threatening
towards a total alienation from the truth once
delivered, what could avail to save them? Nothing but
affliction in the heaviest form. Vain it was now to hope
for a cheaper restoration, since the very first lightening
of their judicial punishment would seem to them a
reason for relapsing, by seeming to argue that there had
been two principles. It was but a false alarm, they
would say, after all. Affliction, therefore, was past all
substitution or remedy. Yet even this case, this prostration
to the ground, had been met for a thousand years
by God's servants.</p>

<br />
<p>If I have shown that quickening spirit which, diffusing
itself through all thoughts, schemata, possible principles,
motives of sensibility, and forms of taste, has
differenced the pre-Christian man from the post-Christian;
if I have detected that secret word which
God subtly introduced into this world, kept in a state of
incubation for two millennia, then with the flames and
visible agency of a volcanic explosion forced into infinite
disruption, caused to kindle into a general fire&mdash;that
word by which sadness is spread over the face of
things, but also infinite grandeur&mdash;then may I rightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
lay this as one chapter of my Emendation of Human
Knowledge.</p>

<br />
<p>The same thing precisely takes place in literature as in
spiritual things. When a man is entangled and suffocated
in business, all relating to that which shrinks up to
a point&mdash;and observe, I do not mean that being conceived
as a tent above his head it contracts, but that, viewed as
a body at a distance, it shrinks up to a point, and really
vanishes as a real thing&mdash;when this happens, having no
subjective existence at all, but purely and intensely objective,
he misconceives it just in the same way as a poor
ignorant man misconceives learning or knowledge; fancying,
<i>e.g.</i>, like Heylius senior, that he ought to know the
road out of the wood in which they were then entangled.</p>

<br />
<p>It is probable that Adam meant only the unity of man
as to his nature, which also is meant by making all men
of one blood. Similarly Boeckh&mdash;<ins class="mycorr" title="en genei">&#949;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#953;</ins>&mdash;which does
not mean that Gods <i>and</i> men are the same, but that of
each the separate race has unity in itself. So the first
man, Adam, will mean the earliest race of men, perhaps
spread through thousands of years.</p>

<br />
<p>It is a violent case of prejudice, this ordinary appeal
of Bossuet, 'Qu'ont gagn&eacute; les philosophes avec leurs
discours pompeux?' (p. 290). Now how <i>should</i> that case
have been tried thoroughly before the printing of books?
Yet it may be said the Gospel <i>was</i> so tried. True, but
without having the power of fully gratifying itself through
the whole range of its capability. That was for a later
time, hence a new proof of its reality.</p>

<br />
<p><i>An Analogy.</i>&mdash;1. I have somewhere read that a wicked
set of Jews, probably, when rebuked for wickedness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
replied, 'What! are we not the peculiar people of God?
Strange, then, if we may not have a privilege more than
others to do wrong!' The wretches fancied that to be
the people of God&mdash;the chosen people&mdash;implied a license
to do wrong, and had a man told them, No, it was just the
other way; they were to be better than others, absolutely,
they would have trembled with wrath.</p>

<p>2. Precisely the same idea, I am sure, lurks in many
minds as to repentance. It is odious to think of, this
making God the abettor and encourager of evil; but I am
sure it is so, viz., that, because God has said He will
have mercy on the penitent, they fancy that, as the chief
consequence from that doctrine, they may commit sins
without anxiety; though others, not under the Christian
privilege, would be called to account for the same sin,
penitent or not penitent. But they&mdash;such is their thought&mdash;are
encouraged to sin by the assurance that repentance
will always be open to them, and this they may pursue
at leisure.</p>

<p>Now, if a man should say: 'But, my friends, this
means <i>real penitence</i>;' they would reply, 'Oh, but we
mean <i>real penitence.</i>' 'Well, if you do, you must know
that that is not always possible.' 'Not possible!' Then
make them understand that; they will roar with wrath,
and protest against it as no privilege at all.</p>

<br />
<p>The literal interpretation of the Mosaic Cosmogony is
the very expression of a barbarian mind and people,
relying so far on magic as to make all natural process of
generation or production impossible, relying so far on
natural processes as to make the fiat of supreme power
evidently inapplicable. It is exactly the Minerva of the
Pagans draggled in her skirts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<br />
<p><i>Idolatry.</i>&mdash;It is not only a mere blind crotchet of Isaiah's
(Jeremiah's?) to ridicule idols&mdash;utterly wide of any real
imperfection, but also it misses all that really might be
bad. The true evil is not to kindle the idea of Apollo by
an image or likeness, but to worship Apollo, <i>i.e.</i>, a god
to be in some sense false&mdash;belonging to a system connected
with evil. That may be bad; but there can be no
separate evil in reanimating the idea of this Apollo by a
picture.</p>

<br />
<p>I have observed many times, but never could understand
in any rational sense, the habit of finding a confirmation
of the Bible in mere arch&aelig;ologic facts occasionally
brought to light and tallying with the Biblical
records. As in the Pharaonic and Egyptian usages, and
lately in the case of Nimrod, a great collateral confirmation
of Ezekiel has been fancied. But how? Supposing
Ezekiel to have recited accurately the dimensions of
Nineveh, how should <i>that</i> make him a true prophet? Or
supposing him a false one, what motive should that
furnish for mismeasuring Nineveh? The Gospels appear
to have been written long after the events, and when
controversies or variations had arisen about them, they
have apparently been modified and shaped to meet those
disputes.</p>

<br />
<p><i>The sun stands still.</i> I am persuaded that this means
no such incredible miracle as is ordinarily imagined.
The interpretation arises from misconceiving an Oriental
expression, and a forcible as well as natural one. Of all
people the Jews could least mistake the nature of the sun
and moon, as though by possibility they could stand in a
relation to a particular valley: that the sun could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
stood still in Gibeon, and the moon in Ajalon. Since
they viewed sun and moon as two great lights, adequated
and corresponding to day and night, that alone shows
that they did not mean any objective solstice of the hour,
for else why in Ajalon? Naturally it would be a phenomenon
chiefly made known to the central sanctity of that
God whose miraculous interposition had caused so unknown
an arrest of ordinary nature; Jerusalem was not
then known, it was Jebus, a city of Jebusites; and the
fact which subsequently created its sanctity did not occur
till more than four centuries afterwards (viz., on the
threshing-floor of Araunah). But Shiloh existed, and
Horeb, and Sinai, and the graves of the Patriarchs. And
all those places would have expounded the reference of
the miracle, would have traced it to the very source of
its origin; so as to show not then only, not to the contemporaries
only, but (which would be much more important)
to after generations, who might suspect some
mistake in their ancestors as explaining their meaning,
or in themselves as understanding it. What it really
means, I am persuaded, is merely to express that the day
was, of all historical days, the most important. What!
do people never reflect on the <ins class="mycorr" title="to">&#964;&#959;</ins> positive of their reading?
If they <i>did</i>, they would remember that the very idea of a
great cardinal event, as of the foundation of the Olympiads,
was as an arrest, a pausing, of time; causing you to
hang and linger on that time. And the grandeur of this
Jewish Waterloo in which God established possessions
for His people and executed an earthly day of judgment
on the ancient polluters (through perhaps a thousand
years) of the sacred land (already sacred as the abode
and burying-place of His first servants under a covenant)
was expressed by saying that the day lingered, arrested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
itself by a burthen of glorious revolution so mighty as
this great day of overthrow. For remember this: Would
not God have changed Pharaoh's heart, so intractable, by
such a miracle, had it been at all open to His eternal
laws? Whereas, if you say, Aye, but on that account
why grant even so much distinction to the day as your
ancestor does? answer, it was the <i>final-cause</i> day.</p>

<br />
<p>The English Church pretends to give away the Bible
without note or comment, or&mdash;which, in fact, is the
meaning&mdash;any impulse or bias to the reader's mind.
The monstrous conceit of the Protestant Churches, viz.,
the right of private judgment (which is, in effect, like the
right to talk nonsense, or the right to criticise Sir John
Herschel's books without mathematics), is thus slavishly
honoured. Yet all is deception. Already in the translation
at many hundred points she has laid a restraining
bias on the reader, already by the division of verses,
already by the running abstracts over the Prophets, she
has done this.</p>

<br />
<p>Can the power adequated to a generation of minds, or
to a succession of many generations, find its comprehension
in an individual? Can the might which overflows
the heaven of heavens be confined within a local
residence like that which twice reared itself by its
foundations, and three times by its battlements, above the
threshing-floor of Araunah?<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Of that mystery, of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>local circumscription&mdash;in what sense it was effected, in
what sense not effected, we know nothing. But this by
mere human meditation, this profound difficulty we may
humanly understand and measure, viz., the all but
impossibility of reaching the man who stands removed to
an extent of fifteen centuries. But here comes in the
unspiritual mind which thinks only of facts&mdash;yet mark
me so far, Rome by an augury of wicked gods stretched
to a period of 1,200 years. Yet how open to doubt in
one sense! Not, I am sure, in any sense understood by
man, but I doubt not in the ominous sense intended.
Changed in all things essential, she was yet a mighty
sceptred potentate for the world until her dependency on
Attila's good-will and forbearance. 444 after Christ
added to 752 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> complete the period. But period for
what? For whom? For a great idea that could not be
lost. The conception could not perish if the execution
perished. But, next think of the temptation to <i>mythus.</i>
And, finally, of God's plan unrealized, His conceptions
unanswered. We should remember that by the confusion
introduced into the economy of internal Divine
operations there is a twofold difficulty placed between
the prayer and the attainment of the prayer. 1st, the
deflection, slight though it may seem to the man, from
the state of perfect simplicity and of natural desire;
2ndly, the deflection of the object desired from the
parallelism with the purposes <i>now</i> became necessary to
God in order to remedy <i>abnormous</i> shifting of the centre
by man. And again, in the question of the language of
Scripture, I see the same illustration. Sir William
Jones, in a fit of luxurious pleasure-giving, like Gibbons'
foolish fit<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as to the Archbishop of Carthagena, praises
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>the language of Scripture as unattainable. I say, No.
This is hypocrisy. It is no dishonour if we say of God
that, in the sense meant by Sir William Jones, it is not
possible for Him to speak better than powerful writers
can speak. They have the same language as their
instrument, and as impossible would it be for Apollonius
or Sir William Jones to perform a simple process of
addition better than an ordinary keeper of a shop. In
the schemata, because in the original ideas, God says
indeed what man cannot, for these are peculiar to God;
but who before myself has shown what they were? As
to mere language, however, and its management, we
have the same identically. And when a language labours
under an infirmity, as all do, not God Himself could
surmount it! He is compromised, coerced, by the
elements of language; but what of that? It is an
element of man's creating. And just as in descending
on man by His answers God is defeated or distorted
many times by the foul atmosphere in which man has
thrown himself, so in descending upon the mind (unless
by dreams, or some language that he may have kept
pure), God is thwarted and controlled by the imperfections
of human language. And, apart from the ideas,
I myself could imitate the Scriptural language&mdash;I know
its secret, its principle of movement which lies chiefly in
high abstractions&mdash;far better than is done in most
parts of the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>The power lies in the spirit&mdash;the animating principle;
and verily such a power seems to exist. And the fact
derived from the holiness, the restraints even upon the
Almighty's power through His own holiness, goodness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>and wisdom, are so vast that, instead of the unlimited
power which hypocritical glorifiers ascribe to Him by
way of lip-honour, in reaching man <i>ex-abundantibus</i> in
so transcendent a way that mere excess of means would
have perplexed a human choice, on the contrary, I am
persuaded that besides the gulf of 1,500 years so as to hold
on, so as to hold hard, and to effect the translation of His
will unaltered, uncorrupted, through the violent assaults
of idolatries all round, and the perverse, headstrong
weakness of a naturally unbelieving people,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> down to the
time of Christ from the time of Moses&mdash;there was the
labour hardly to be effected; and why? I have always
been astonished at men treating such a case as a simple
<i>original</i> problem as to God. But far otherwise. It was
a problem secondary to a change effected by man. His
rays, His sun, still descended as ever; but when they
came near to the foul atmosphere of man, no ray could
pierce unstained, unrefracted, or even untwisted. It was
distorted so as to make it hardly within the limits of
human capacity (observe, the difficulty was in the human
power to receive, to sustain, to comprehend&mdash;not in the
Divine power to radiate, to receive what was directed to
it). Often I have reflected on the tremendous gulf of
separation placed between man, by his own act, and all
the Divine blessings which could visit him. (This is
illustrated by prayer; for, while we think it odd that so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>many prayers of good men for legitimate objects of prayer
should seem to be unanswered, we nevertheless act as to
our prayers in a kind of unconscious hypocrisy, as though
to our sense they had been answered in some ineffable
way, and all the while our conduct, to speak strictly, lies
outside all this, and remains wholly uninfluenced by it).</p>

<p>These ideas of God have life only by their own inherent
power: yet what risk that Jews should lapse into supposing
themselves separately a favoured people? By
this very error they committed the rebellion against
which they had been warned&mdash;in believing that they
only were concerned in receiving a supernatural aid of
redemption: thus silently substituting their own merits
for the Divine purposes. All which did in fact happen.
But their errors were overruled, else how could the
human race be concerned in their offences, errors, or
ministries? The Jews forgot what we moderns forget,
that they were no separate objects of favour with God,
but only a means of favour.</p>

<p>What occasion to 'argal-bargal' about why God did not
sooner accomplish the scheme of Christianity? For besides
that, 1st, possibly the scheme in its expansion upon
earth required a corresponding expansion elsewhere;
2ndly, it is evident even to our human sense that none
but the most childish eudamonist, whose notion of happiness
is that of lazy luxury, would think of cramming men,
bidding them open their mouths, and at once drugging
them with a sensual opium (as all blessing must be without
previous and commensurate elevation to the level of
that blessing); 3rdly, the physical nature of the evil to
be undone was such as would not have <i>been</i> (<i>objectively</i>
would not have been, but still less could it <i>subjectively</i>
have been) for the conception of man that dreadful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
mystery which it really is, had the awful introversion
been measured back by fewer steps; 4thly, and finally, it
seems at first sight shocking to say of God that He cannot
do this and this, but it is not so. Without adverting
to the dark necessities that compass our chaotic sense
when we ascend by continual abstraction to the <i>absolute</i>,
without entangling ourselves vainly in those wildernesses
that no created intellect can range or measure&mdash;even one
sole attribute of God, His holiness, makes it as impossible
for Him to proceed except by certain steps as it
would be impossible for a man, though a free agent, and
apparently master, as he feels and thinks, of his own life,
to cut his throat while in a state of pleasurable health
both of mind and body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>


<h3>5.&mdash;Political, etc.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<p>Sir Robert Walpole, as to patriots, was like a man
who has originally, from his nursery up, been thoroughly
imbued with the terror of ghosts, which by education
and example afterwards he has been encouraged to deny.
Half he does disbelieve, and, under encouraging circumstances,
he does disbelieve it stoutly. But at every fresh
plausible alarm his early faith intrudes with bitter hatred
against a class of appearances that, after all, he is upon
system pledged to hold false. Nothing can be more ludicrous
than his outcry, and his lashing of his own tail to
excite his courage and his wrath and his denial&mdash;than his
challenge of the lurking patriots in what he conceives the
matter of frauds on the revenue. He assaults them as if
he saw them standing in a row behind the door, and yet
he pummels them for being mere men of the shades&mdash;horrible
mockeries. Had there been any truth in their
existence, surely, so strongly as they muster by their own
report, some one or other of this fact should have given
me warning&mdash;should have exposed the frauds. But no,
all are silent as the grave. But here Sir Robert Walpole
is as much wrong as if, doubting the value or power of
Methodist preachers, he should make it the test of their
useful existence that, as often as a highwayman, a footpad,
started out of the wayside, from the other side should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
start a Methodist preacher to reason with him and to
convert him.</p>

<br />
<p>Are the Whigs less aristocratic than the Tories? Not
at all. In tendency by principle they are the same. The
real difference is not in the creed, in the groundwork, but
in certain points of practice and method.</p>

<br />
<p>'He took his stand upon the truth'&mdash;said by me of Sir
Robert Peel&mdash;might seem to argue a lower use of '<i>the</i> truth,'
but in fact it is as happens to the article <i>the</i> itself:
you say <i>the</i> guard, speaking of a coach; <i>the</i> key, speaking
of a trunk or watch, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>the</i> as by usage appropriated to
every coach, watch, trunk. So here the truth, namely,
of the particular perplexity.</p>

<br />
<p>The Sepoy mutiny will be best understood if you suppose
the Roman emperors, from Romulus to Augustus,
from the Alban Fathers down to the Ostrogoths&mdash;the
whole line of a thousand years crowded into two.</p>

<br />
<p>Trunkmakers may be great men: they clearly have
the upper hand of authors whom all the world admits to
be great men. For the trunkmaker is the <i>principal</i> in
the concern&mdash;he makes the trunk, whereas the author,
quite a secondary artist, furnishes only the linings.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p><i>Case of Casuistry.</i>&mdash;Wraxall justly notices that errors
like Prince Rupert's from excess of courage, however
ruinous, are never resented by a country. <i>Ergo</i> the
inference that prudence would be, always if in Byng's or
Lord St. German's cases, in a matter of doubt held to be
bold fighting; and yet in morals is that an allowable
position?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>


<h3>6.&mdash;Personal Confessions, etc.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<p>Avaunt, ye hypocrites! who make a whining pretence,
according to a fixed rule, of verbally uttering thanks to
God for every chastisement, and who say this is good
for you. So do not I, being upright, and God seeing
my heart, who also sees that I murmur not; but if it
were not good in the end, yet I submit. He is not
offended that with upright sincerity I give no thanks for
it. And I say that, unless a man perceives the particular
way in which it has been good for him, he cannot
sincerely, truly, or so as not to mock God with his lips,
give thanks simply on an <i>&agrave; priori</i> principle, though, of
course, he may submit in humbleness.</p>

<br />
<p>I do not believe that the faith of any man in the
apparent fact that he will never again see such a person
(<i>i.e.</i>, by being removed by death) is real. I believe that
the degree of faith in this respect is regulated by an
original setting or fixing of our nature quite unconscious
to ourselves. So, again, I believe that hope is never
utterly withdrawn, despair is never absolute. And
again, I believe that, at the lowest nadir, the resource
of dying as a means of escape and translation to new
chances and openings is lodged in every man far down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
below the sunlights of consciousness. He feels that his
death is not final; were it otherwise he could not rush
at the escape so lightly. Indeed, were his fate fixed
immutably, I feel that it would not have been left
possible for him to commit suicide.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Justice.</i>&mdash;You say in the usual spirit of vanity, Y or X
has the same degree of the spirit of justice as V. This
is easily said, but the test is, what will he <i>do</i> for it?
Suppose a man to propose rewards exclusively to those
who assisted at a fire, then X and Y, suppose, have
equally seen that many did <i>not</i> assist, even refused to
do so. But X perhaps will shrink from exposing them;
V will encounter any hatred for truth and justice by
exposing the undeserving.</p>

<br />
<p>It is a foolish thing to say 'Hard words break no
bones.' How impossible to call up from the depths of
forgotten times all the unjust or shocking insinuations,
all the scornful refusals to understand one aright, etc.
But surely an injury is nothing to them; for that may
be measured, made sensible, and cannot be forgotten,
whereas the other case is like the dispute, 'Is he
wrong as a <i>poet</i>?' compared with this, 'Is he wrong
as a <i>geometrician</i>?' There need be no anger with the
latter dispute; it is capable of decision.</p>

<br />
<p>Then, again, a heart so lacerated is required by
Christianity to forgive the lacerator. Hard it is to do,
and imperfectly it is ever done, except through the
unbuckling of human nature under higher inspirations
<i>working together with time.</i></p>

<br />
<p>Instead of being any compliment it is the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
profound insult, the idea one can write something
rapidly. It is no homage to the writer; it is villainous
insensibility to the written.</p>

<br />
<p>Two subjects of stories occur to me. 1. For my
Arabian tales, founded on the story of the Minyas
Treasure-House at Orchomenus. 2. Another of an
abbess, who was such by dispensation, but had been
married; her accomplished son succeeds in carrying off
a nun. She labours for the discovery and punishment
of the unknown criminal, till she learns who he is; then
parting from him for ever in the early dawn, she,
sacrificing to a love that for her was to produce only
hatred and the total destruction of the total hopes of
her ageing life. Splendide Mendax! and the more
angel she.</p>

<br />
<p>I find the double effect as the reason of my now
reading again with profit every book, however often read
in earlier times, that by and through my greater knowledge
and the more numerous questions growing out of
that knowledge, I have deeper interest, and by and
through this deeper interest I have a value put upon
those questions, and I have other questions supervening
through the interest alone. The interest is incarnated
in the wider knowledge; the knowledge is incarnated
in the interest, or at least the curiosity and questions.</p>

<br />
<p>Upon trying to imprint upon my memory that at such
a period the Argives ceased to be called Pelasgi, and
were henceforward called Danai, I felt how impracticable
(and doubtless in their degree injurious, for though an
infinitesimal injury only as regards any single act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
doubtless, yet, <i>per se</i>, by tendency doubtless all blank
efforts of the memory unsupported by the understanding
are bad), must be any violent efforts of the memory not
falling in with a previous preparedness.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Music.</i>&mdash;I am satisfied that music involves a far
greater mystery than we are aware of. It is that
universal language which binds together all creatures,
and binds them by a profounder part of their nature
than anything merely intellectual ever could.</p>

<br />
<p>It is remarkable (as proving to me the delibility of
caste) that the Sudras of Central India, during its vast
confusions under the Mahrattas have endeavoured to
pass themselves for descendants of the Kshatriyas (or
warrior caste) by assuming the sacred thread, also
assumed by the Rajpoots, and also by some of the Sikhs.</p>

<br />
<p>I never see a vast crowd of faces&mdash;at theatres, races,
reviews&mdash;but one thing makes them sublime to me: the
fact that all these people have to die. Strange it is that
this multitude of people, so many of them intellectually,
but also (which is worse) morally, blind, are without
forethought or sense of the realities of life.</p>

<br />
<p>Though I love fun, eternal jesting, buffoonery, punning
absolutely kills me. Such things derive all their value
from being made to intervene well with other things.</p>

<br />
<p>This is curious:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shame, pain, and poverty shall I endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ropes or opium can my ease procure?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>This offends nobody, not till you say, 'I'll buy a rope.'
But now:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When money's gone, and I no debts can pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Self-murder</i> is an honourable way&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>though the same essentially, this shocks all men.</p>

<br />
<p>I have in the course of my misfortunes fasted for
thirty years: a dreadful fate, if it had been to come.
But, being past, it is lawful to regard it with satisfaction,
as having, like all fasting and mortification, sharpened
to an excruciating degree my intellectual faculties.
Hence my love and even furor now for mathematics,
from which in my youth I fled.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrow Ketch</i>, six guns, is recorded in the <i>Edinburgh

(to Portsmouth) on Thursday, June 7th, 'after six years
and upwards in commission,' most of it surveying the
Falkland Islands; 'has lost only two men during this
long service, and those from natural causes;' 'never
lost a spar, and has ploughed the ocean for upwards of

want of granaries or mendacious violence destroying
food, civil feuds coming round in internecine wars, and

<p>In the speech of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh
(reported on June 14th, 1844), it is recited that boys
'left to stroll about the streets and closes,' acquire
habits so fixed, if not of vice, at least of idleness, that
in consequence of their not being trained to some kind
of discipline in their early years, the habit of vagabondizing
acquires such power that it is uncontrollable. And
how apt and forcible was that quotation in the place
assigned it: 'If thou forbear to deliver them that are
drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;
if thou sayest, <i>Behold, we knew it not</i>, doth not He that
pondereth the heart, consider it?'&mdash;consider it, regard

<p>I confess myself wholly at a loss to comprehend the
objections of the Westminster reviewer and even of my
friend Dr. Nichol, to my commentary on the strange
appearance in Orion. The reviewer says that this
appearance (on which he seems to find my language
incomprehensible) had been dispersed by Lord Rosse's
telescope. True, or at least so I hear. But for all this,
it was originally created by that telescope. It was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the interval between the first report and the subsequent
reports from Lord Rosse's telescope that I made my
commentary. But in the case of contradiction between
two reports, more accurate report I have not. As
regards the reviewer, there had been no time for this,
because the book, which he reviews, is a simple reprint
in America, which he knows I had had no opportunity
of revising. But Dr. Nichol perplexes me. That a
new stage of progress had altered the appearances, as
doubtless further stages will alter them, concerns me
nothing, though referring to a coming republication;
for both alike apparently misunderstood the case as
though it required a <i>real</i> phenomenon for its basis.
To understand the matter as it really is, I beg to state
this case. Wordsworth in at least four different places
(one being in the fourth book of 'The Excursion,' three
others in Sonnets) describes most impressive appearances
amongst the clouds: a monster, for instance, with a bell-hanging
air, a dragon agape to swallow a golden spear,
and various others of affecting beauty. Would it have
been any just rebuke to Wordsworth if some friend had
written to him: 'I regret most sincerely to say that
the dragon and the golden spear had all vanished before
nine o'clock'? So, again, of Hawthorne's face on a rock.
The very beauty of such appearances is in part their
evanescence.</p>

<p>We must never forget, that it is not <i>impar</i> merely, but
also <i>dispar.</i> And such is its value in this light, that I
protest five hundred kings' ransoms, nay, any sum conceivable
as a common contribution from all nations would
not be too much for the infinite treasure of the Greek
tragic drama alone. Is it superior to our own? No,
nor (so far as capable of collation) not by many degrees
approaching to it. And were the case, therefore, one
merely of degrees, there would be no room for the pleasure
I express. But it shows us the ultimatum of the
human mind mutilated and castrated of its infinities, and
(what is worse) of its moral infinities.</p>

<p>Valckenaer, an admirable Greek scholar, was not a
man of fine understanding; nor, to say the truth, was
Porson. Indeed, it is remarkable how mean, vulgar,
and uncapacious has been the range of intellect in many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
first-rate Grecians; though, on the other hand, the
reader would deeply deceive himself if he should imagine
that Greek is an attainment other than difficult, laborious,
and requiring exemplary talents. Greek taken
singly is, to use an indispensable Latin word, <i>instar</i>,
the knowledge of all other languages. But men of
the highest talents have often beggarly understandings.
Hence, in the case of Valckenaer, we must derive the
contradictions in his diatribe. He practises this intolerable
artifice; he calls himself <ins class="mycorr" title="philenripideios">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#957;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins>; bespeaks an
unfair confidence from the reader; he takes credit for
being once disposed to favour and indulge Euripides.
In this way he accredits to the careless reader all the
false charges or baseless concessions which he makes on
any question between Euripides and his rivals. Such
men as Valckenaer it is who are biased and inflected
beforehand, without perceiving it, by all the commonplaces
of criticism. These, it is true, do not arise out of
mere shadows. Usually they have a foundation in some
fact or modification. What they fail in is, in the just
interpretation of these truths, and in the reading of their
higher relations. 'The Correggiosity of Correggio' was
precisely meant for Valckenaer. The Sophocleity of
Sophocles he is keen to recognise, and the superiority
of Sophocles as an artist is undeniable; nor is it an
advantage difficult to detect. On the other hand, to be
more Homeric than Homer is no praise for a tragic
poet. It is far more just, pertinent praise, it is a ground
of far more interesting praise, that Euripides is granted
by his undervalues to be the most <i>tragic</i> (<ins class="mycorr" title="tragichotatos">&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#953;&#967;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>)
of tragic poets. After that he can afford to let Sophocles
be '<ins class="mycorr" title="Homerich&ocirc;tos">&#8009;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#967;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>, who, after all,

as &AElig;schylus survives. But even so far we are valuing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Euripides as a poet. In another character, as a philosopher,
as a large capacious thinker, as a master of
pensive and sorrow-tainted wisdom, as a large reviewer
of human life, he is as much beyond all rivalship from
his scenic brethren as he is below one of them as a scenic
artist.</p>

<p><i>Growth of the House of Commons.</i>&mdash;The House of
Commons was the power of the purse, and what gave
its emphasis to that power? Simply the growing necessity
of standing forces, and the growing increase of war,
so that now out of twenty millions, fifteen are applied to
army and navy.</p>

<p>One great evil, as in practice it had begun to show
itself, pressed with equal injustice on the party who
suffered from it (viz., the nation), and the party who
seemed to reap its benefit. This was the fact that as
yet no separation had taken place between the royal
peculiar revenue, and that of the nation. The advance
of the nation was now (1603, 1st of James I.) approaching
to the point which made the evil oppression, and yet
had not absolutely reached the point at which it could
be undeniably perceived. Much contest and debate
divided the stage of incipient evil from the stage of confessed
grievance. In spending &pound;100,000 upon a single
f&ecirc;te, James I. might reasonably allege that he misapplied,
at any rate, his own funds. Wise or not, the act concerned
his own private household. Yet, on the other
hand, in the case of money <i>really</i> public, the confusion
of the two expenditures invited and veiled the transfer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
of much from national objects that could wait, and were,
at any rate, hidden from effectual scrutiny to the private
objects which tempted the king's profusion. When Mr.
Macaulay speaks so often of England sinking under this
or that Stuart to a third-rate power, he is anachronizing.
There was no scale of powers. Want of roads and intercommunication
forbade it. And hence until the Thirty
Years' War there was no general war. Austria, as by fiction
the Roman Empire, and always standing awfully near to
North Italy, had a natural relation and gravitation towards
Rome. France, by vainglory and the old literary
pretensions of Anjou, had also a balancing claim upon
Italy. Milanese formed indeed (as Flanders afterwards)
the rendezvous for the two powers. Otherwise, only
Austria and Spain (and Spain not till joined to Austria)
and France&mdash;as great powers that touched each other
in many points&mdash;had ever formed a warlike trio. No
quadrille had existed until the great civil war for life
and death between Popery and Protestantism. It was
another great evil that the functions towards which, by
inevitable instincts and tendency of progress, the House
of Commons was continually travelling,&mdash;not, I repeat,
through any encroaching spirit as the Court and that
House of Commons itself partially fancied,&mdash;were not yet
developed: false laws of men, <i>i.e.</i>, laws framed under
theories misunderstood of rights and constitutional
powers, having as much distorted the true natural play
of the organic manifestation and tendency towards a
whole, as ever a dress too tight, or a flower-pot too
narrow, impeded the development of child or plant.
Queen Elizabeth, therefore, always viewed the House
of Commons as a disturber of the public peace, as a
mutineer and insurrectionist, when any special accident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
threw it upon its natural function; she spoke of State
affairs, and especially of foreign affairs, as beyond their
'<i>capacity</i>,' which expression, however, must in charity
be interpreted philosophically as meaning the range of
comprehension consistent with their <i>total</i> means of instruction
and preparation, including, therefore, secret
information, knowledge of disposable home resources as
known to the official depositaries of State secrets, etc.,
and not, as the modern reader will understand it, simply
and exclusively the intellectual power of appreciation.
Since, with all her disposition to exalt the qualities of
princely persons, she could not be so absurdly haughty
as to claim for princes and the counsellors whom interest
or birth had suggested to them a precedency in pure
natural endowments.</p>

<p>Charles was a sincere believer but not an earnest

<br />
<p><i>The Reformation.</i>&mdash;This seems to show two things: 1st,
that a deep searching and 'sagacious-from-afar' spirit of
morality can mould itself under the prompting of
Christianity, such as could not have grown up under
Paganism. For it was the abominations in point of
morality (<i>en fait de moralit&eacute;?</i>)&mdash;indulgences, the confessional,
absolution, the prevalence of a mere ritual&mdash;the
usurpation of forms&mdash;these it was which Rome
treated violently; and if she draw in her horns for the
present, still upon any occasion offering, upon the cloud
of peril passing away, clearly she would renew her
conduct. It was a tendency violently and inevitably
belonging to the Roman polity combined with the
Roman interest, unless, perhaps, as permanently con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>trolled
by a counter-force. 2ndly, the synthesis of this
curative force is by apposition of parts separately hardly
conscious of the danger or even of their own act. For
we cannot suppose the vast body of opposition put
forward was so under direct conscious appreciation of
the evil and by an adequate counter-action&mdash;doubtless it
was by sympathy with others having better information.
These last burned more vividly as the evil was fiercer.
That more vivid sympathy drew increase of supporters.</p>

<p>The rule is to speak like the foolish, and think like the
wise, and therefore I agree to call our worthy old mother
'little'&mdash;our 'little island'&mdash;as that seems to be the
prevailing notion; otherwise I myself consider Great
Britain rather a tall island. A man is not called short
because some few of his countrymen happen to be a
trifle taller; and really I know but of two islands, among
tens of thousands counted up by gazetteers on our
planet, that are taller; and I fancy, with such figures as
theirs, they are neither of them likely to think of any
rivalship with our dear old mother. What island, for
instance, would choose to be such a great fat beast as
Borneo, as broad as she is long, with no apology for a
waist? Talk of lacing too tight, indeed! I'm sure
Borneo does not injure herself in that way. Now our
mother, though she's old, and has gone through a world
of trouble in her time, is as jimp about the waist as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
young lass of seventeen. Look at her on any map of
Europe, and she's quite a picture. It's an old remark
that the general outline of the dear creature exactly
resembles a lady sitting. She turns her back upon the
Continent, no doubt, and that's what makes those
foreigneering rascals talk so much of her pride. But she
<i>must</i> turn her back upon somebody, and who is it that
should have the benefit of her countenance, if not those
people in the far West that are come of her own blood?
They say she's 'tetchy' also. Well, then, if she is, you
let her alone, good people of the Continent. She'll not
meddle with you if you don't meddle with her. She's
kind enough, and, as to her person, I do maintain that
she's quite tall enough, rather thin, it's true, but, on the
whole, a bonny, elegant, dear old fighting mamma.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Mora Alexandrina.</i>&mdash;Note on Middleton's affected
sneer. A villa of Cicero's, where probably the usual
sound heard would be the groans of tormented slaves,
had been changed for the cells of Christian monks.
Now mark: what the hound Middleton means is, how
shocking to literary sensibilities that where an elegant
master of Latinity had lived, there should succeed dull,
lazy monks, writing (if they wrote at all) in a barbarous
style, and dreaming away their lives in torpor. Now
permit me to pause a little. This is one of those sneers
which Paley<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and Bishop Butler<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> think so unanswerable,
that we must necessarily lie down and let the
sneer ride rough-shod over us all. Let us see, and for
this reason, reader, do not grudge a little delay, especially
as you may 'skip' it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Conyers ought to have remembered, in the first
place, that the villa could not long remain in the hands
of Cicero. Another owner would succeed, and then the
chances would be that the sounds oftenest ascending in
the hour of sunset or in the cool of the dawn would be
the shrieks of slaves under torture. By their own poor
miserable fare contrasted with the splendour reeking
around them, these slaves had a motive, such as our
tenderly-treated (often pampered) servants can never know
the strength of, for breaking the seal of any wine cask.
From the anecdote told of his own mother by the wretched
Quintus Cicero, the foul brother of Marcus, it appears
that generally there was some encouragement to do this,
on the chance of 'working down' on the master that
the violated seal had been amongst the casks legitimately
opened. For it seems that old Mrs. Cicero's housewifely
plan was to seal up all alike, empty and not empty.
Consequently with her no such excuse could avail.
Which proves that often it <i>did</i> avail, since her stratagem
is mentioned as a very notable artifice. What follows?
Why, that the slave was doubly tempted: 1st, by the
luxury he witnessed; 2ndly, by the impunity on which
he might calculate. Often he escaped by sheer weight
of metal in lying. Like Chaucer's miller, he swore,
when charged with stealing flour, that it was not so.
But this very prospect and likelihood of escape was often
the very snare for tempting to excesses too flagrant or
where secret marks had been fixed. Besides, many other
openings there were, according to the individual circumstances,
but this was a standing one, for tempting the
poor unprincipled slave into trespass that irritated either
the master or the mistress. And then came those
periodical lacerations and ascending groans which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Seneca mentions as the best means of telling what
o'clock it was in various households, since the punishments
were going on just at that hour.</p>

<p>After, when the gracious revolution of Christianity had
taught us, and by a memento so solemn and imperishable,
no longer to pursue our human wrath, that hour of
vesper sanctity had come, which, by the tendency of the
Christian law and according to the degree in which it is
observed, is for us a type and a symbol and a hieroglyphic
of wrath extinguished, of self-conquest, of charity
in heaven and on earth.</p>

<p>Now, the monks, it is supposable, might be commonplace
drones. Often, however, they would be far other,
transmitters by their copying toils of those very Ciceronian
works which, but for them, would have perished.
And pausing duly here, what sense, what propriety
would there be in calling on the reader to notice with a
shock the profanation of classical ground in such an
example as this: 'Mark the strange revolutions of ages;
there, where once the divine Plato's Academus stood,
now rises a huge printing-house chiefly occupied for the
last two years in reprinting Plato's works.' Why, really
Plato himself would look graciously on that revolution,
Master Conyers. But next, the dullest of these monks
would hear the Gloria in Excelsis.</p>

<br />
<p>Oh, how pitiful it is to hear B&mdash;&mdash; alleging against
Mahomet that he had done no public miracles. What?
Would it, then, alter your opinion of Mahomet if he <i>had</i>
done miracles? What a proof, how full, how perfect!
That Christianity, in spirit, in power, in simplicity, and
in truth, had no more hold over B&mdash;&mdash; than it had over
any Pagan Pontiff in Rome, is clear to me from that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
So, then, the argument against Mahomet is not that he
wants utterly the meekness&mdash;wants? wants? No, that
he utterly hates the humility, the love that is stronger
than the grave, the purity that cannot be imagined, the
holiness as an ideal for man that cannot be approached,
the peace that passeth all understanding, that power
which out of a little cloud no bigger than a man's hand
grows for ever and ever until it will absorb the world
and all that it inherit, that first of all created the terror
of death and the wormy grave; but that first and last
she might triumph over time&mdash;not these, it seems by
B&mdash;&mdash;, are the arguments against Mahomet, but that he
did not play legerdemain tricks, that he did not turn a
cow into a horse!</p>

<p>In which position B&mdash;&mdash; is precisely on a level with
those Arab Sheikhs, or perhaps Mamelukes, whom
Napoleon so foolishly endeavoured to surprise by
Chinese tricks: 'Aye, all this is very well, but can you
make one to be in Cairo and in Damascus at the same
moment?' demanded the poor brutalized wretches. And
so also for B&mdash;&mdash; it is nothing. Oh, blind of heart not
to perceive that the defect was entirely owing to the age.
Mahomet came to a most sceptical region. There was no
semblance or shadow among the Arabs of that childish
credulity which forms the atmosphere for miracle. On
the contrary, they were a hard, fierce people, and in that
sense barbarous; but otherwise they were sceptical, as
is most evident from all that they accomplished, which
followed the foundation of Islamism. Here lies the
delusion upon that point. The Arabs were evidently
like all the surrounding nations. They were also much
distinguished among all Oriental peoples for courage.
This fact has been put on record in (1) the East Indies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
where all the Arab troops have proved themselves by far
more formidable than twelve times the number of
effeminate Bengalese and Mahrattas, etc. (2) At Aden,
where as rude fighters without the science of war they
have been most ugly customers. (3) In Algeria, where the
French, with all advantage of discipline, science, artillery,
have found it a most trying and exhausting war. Well,
as they are now, so they were before Mahomet, and just
then they were ripe for conquest. But they wanted a
<i>combining</i> motive and a <i>justifying</i> motive. Mahomet
supplied both these. Says he, 'All nations are idolaters;
go and thrust them into the mill that they may be
transformed to our likeness.'</p>

<p>Consequently, the great idea of the truth, of a truth
transcending all available rights on the other side, was
foreign to Mahometanism, and any glimmering of this
that may seem to be found in it was borrowed, was
filched from Christianity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>The three greatest powers which we know of in moulding
human feelings are, first, Christianity; secondly, the
actions of men emblazoned by history; and, in the third
place, poetry. If the first were represented to the imagination
by the atmospheric air investing our planet,
which we take to be the most awful laboratory of powers&mdash;mysterious,
unseen, and absolutely infinite&mdash;the second
might be represented by the winds, and the third by
lightning. Napoleon and Lord Byron have done more
mischief to the moral feelings, to the truth of all moral
estimates, to the grandeur and magnanimity of man, in
this present generation, than all other causes acting
together. But how? Simply by throwing human feelings
into false combinations. Both of them linked the mean
to the grand, the base to the noble, in a way which often
proves fatally inextricable to the poor infirm mind of the
ordinary spectator. Here is Napoleon, simply because
he wields a vast national machinery, throwing a magic of
celerity and power into a particular action which absolutely
overpowers the <i>genus attonitorum</i>, so that they are
reconciled by the dazzle of a splendour not at all <i>in</i>
Napoleon, to a baseness which really <i>is</i> in Napoleon.
The man that never praised an enemy is shown to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
vile mob by the light thrown off from the radiant power
of France as the greatest of men; he is confounded with
his supporting element, even as the Jupiter Olympus of
Phidias, that never spared a woman in his lust, seemed
the holiest of deities when his rottenness was concealed
by ivory and gold, and his libidinous head was lighted
up by sunbeams from above. Here is Lord Byron connecting,
in the portrait of some poor melodramatic hero
possibly, some noble quality of courage or perseverance
with scorn the most puerile and senseless. Prone enough
is poor degraded human nature to find something grand
in scorn; but, after this arbitrary combination of Lord
Byron's, never again does the poor man think of scorn
but it suggests to him moral greatness, nor think of greatness
but it suggests scorn as its indispensable condition.</p>

<br />
<p>Wordsworth is always recording phenomena as they
are enjoyed; Coleridge as they reconcile themselves with
opposing or conflicting phenomena.</p>

<br />
<p>W. W.'s social philosophy is surely shallow. It is
true the man who has a shallow philosophy under the
guidance of Christianity has a profound philosophy. But
this apart, such truths as 'He who made the creature
will allow for his frailties,' etc., are commonplace.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Invention as a Characteristic of Poets.</i>&mdash;I happened
this evening (Saturday, August 3rd, '44) to be saying
of W. W. to myself: 'No poet is so free from all cases
like this, viz., where all the feelings and spontaneous
thoughts which they have accumulated coming to an
end, and yet the case seeming to require more to finish
it, or bring it round, like a peal of church bells, they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
forced to invent, and form descants on raptures never
really felt. Suddenly this suggested that invention,
therefore, so far from being a differential quality of
poetry, was, in fact, the polar opposite, spontaneousness
being the true quality.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Tragedy.</i>&mdash;I believe it is a very useful thing to let
young persons cultivate their kind feelings by repeated
indulgences. Thus my children often asked when anything
was to be paid or given to any person, that they
might have the satisfaction of giving it. So I see clearly
that young boys or girls allowed to carry abroad their
infant brothers and sisters, when the little creature feels
and manifests a real dependence upon them in every
act and movement, which <i>matre pr&aelig;sente</i> they would not
have done, which again seen and felt calls out every
latent goodness of the elder child's heart. So again
(here I have clipped out the case). However, feeding
rabbits, but above all the action upon women's hearts
in the enormous expansion given by the relation to
their own children, develops a feeling of tenderness that
afterwards sets the model for the world, and would die
away, or freeze, or degenerate, if it were generally
balked. Now just such an action has tragedy, and if
the sympathy with calamities caused to noble natures
by ignobler, or by dark fates, were never opened or
moved or called out, it would slumber inertly, it would
rust, and become far less ready to respond upon any
call being made. Such sensibilities are not consciously
known to the possessor until developed.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Punctuation.</i>&mdash;Suppose an ordinary case where the
involution of clauses went three deep, and that each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
was equally marked off by commas, now I say that so
far from aiding the logic it would require an immense
effort to distribute the relations of logic. But the very
purpose and use of points is to aid the logic. If indeed
you could see the points at all in this relation</p>

<pre>
              strophe                     antistrophe
        1     2     3                    3     2     1
        &mdash;&mdash;,   &mdash;&mdash;,   &mdash;&mdash;,         apodosis &mdash;&mdash;,   &mdash;&mdash;,   &mdash;&mdash;,
</pre>

<p>then indeed all would be clear, but the six commas will
and must be viewed by every reader unversed in the logical
mechanism of sentences as merely a succession of ictuses,
so many minute-guns having no internal system of
correspondence, but merely repeating and reiterating
each other, exactly as in men, guns, horses, timbrels,
baggage-waggons, standards.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Sheridan's Disputatiousness.</i>&mdash;I never heard of any
case in the whole course of my life where disputatiousness
was the author of any benefit to man or beast,
excepting always one, in which it became a storm
anchor for poor Sheridan, saving him from sudden shipwreck.
This may be found in Mr. Moore's life, somewhere
about the date of 1790, and in chapter xiii.
The book is thirty-seven miles off, which is too far to
send for water, or for scandal, or even for 'extract,'
though I'm 'fond of extract.' Therefore, in default of
Mr. Moore's version, I give my own. The situation was
this: Sheridan had been cruising from breakfast to
dinner amongst Jews, Christians, and players (men,
women, and Herveys),<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and constantly in the same
hackney coach, so that the freight at last settled like
the sand-heap of an hour-glass into a frightful record of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>costly moments. <i>Pereunt et imputantur</i>, say some impertinent
time-pieces, in speaking of the hours. They
perish and are debited to our account. Yes, and what
made it worse, the creditor was an inexorable old Jarvie,
who, though himself a creditor, had never heard the idea
of credit. A guinea might be owing, and Sheridan,
seldom remembering his purse, had but a shilling, which
even in a court of Irish law seemed too small a compromise
to offer. Black looked the horizon, stormy the
offing, and night was coming on, whilst the port of consignment
was now within thirty minutes' sail. Suddenly
a sight of joy was described. Driving before the wind,
on bare poles, was a well-known friend of Sheridan's,
Richardson, famed for various talent, but also for an
invincible headlong necessity of disputing. To pull the
check-string, to take his friend on board, and to rush
into fierce polemic conversation was the work of a
moment for Sheridan. He well understood with this
familiar friend how to bring on a hot dispute. In three
minutes it raged, yard-arm to yard-arm. Both grew
warm. Sheridan grew purple with rage. Violently interrupting
Richardson, he said: 'And these are your
real sentiments?' Richardson with solemnity and
artificial restraint replied: 'Most solemnly they are.'
'And you stand to them, and will maintain them?' 'I
will,' said Richardson, with menacing solemnity and
even mournfulness. 'I will to my dying day.' 'Then,'
said Sheridan furiously, 'I'm hanged if I'll stay another
minute with a man capable of such abominable opinions!'
Bang went the door, out he bounced, and Richardson,
keeping his seat, pursued him with triumphant explosions.
'Ah, wretch! what? you can't bear the truth. You're
obliged to hate the truth. That is why you cut and run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
before it. Huzza! Mr. Sheridan, M. P. for Stafford,
runs like a hare for fear that he should hear the truth.'
Precisely so, the truth it was that he ran from. The
truth at this particular moment was too painful to his
heart. Sheridan had fled; the awful truth amounted to
eighteen shillings.</p>

<p>Yes, virtuous Richardson, you were right; truth it
was that he fled from; truth had just then become too
painful to his infirm mind, although it was useless to
tell him so, as by this time he was out of hearing. 'Yes,'
said Richardson meditatively to himself, 'the truth has
at last become insupportable to this unhappy man.'
Right, it <i>had</i> so. And in one minute more it became
insupportable even to the virtuous Richardson, when the
coachman revealed the odious extent of the truth, viz.,
that the fare now amounted to two-and-twenty shillings.</p>

<p>As I hate everything that the people love, and above
all the odious levity with which they adopt every
groundless anecdote, especially where it happens to be
calumnious, I beg not to be supposed a believer in the
common stories current about Sheridan's carelessness
of pecuniary obligations. So far from 'never paying,'
which is what public slander has not ceased to report
of him, he was (in Mr. Moore's language) '<i>always</i>
paying;' and for once that he paid too little, a thousand
times he paid a great deal too much. Had, indeed, all
his excesses of payment been gathered into one fund,
that fund would have covered his deficits ten times over.
It is, however, true that, whilst he was continually paying
the hundred-pound demands against him, with all their
Jewish accumulations of interest, he was continually
unfurnished with money for his 'menus plaisirs' and
trifling personal expenses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>By strong natural tendency of disposition, Sheridan
was a man of peculiarly sensitive honour, and the
irregularities into which he fell, more conspicuously
after the destruction of Drury Lane by fire, pained nobody
so much as himself. It is the sense of this fact, and
the belief that Sheridan was never a defaulter through
habits of self-indulgence, which call out in <i>my</i> mind a
reaction of indignation at the stories current against him.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Bookbinding and Book-Lettering.</i>&mdash;Literature is a
mean thing enough in the ordinary way of pursuing it
as what the Germans call a <i>Brodstudium</i>; but in its
higher relations it is so noble that it is able to ennoble
other things, supposing them in any degree ministerial
to itself. The paper-maker, ergo the rag-maker, ergo the
linen cloth-maker, is the true and original creator of the
modern press, as the Archbishop of Dublin long ago
demonstrated. For the art of printing had never halted
for want of the typographic secret; <i>that</i> was always
known, known and practised hundreds of years before
the Christian era. It halted for want of a material
cheap enough and plentiful enough to make types other
than a most costly substitute for hand-copying. Do
you hear <i>that</i>, gentlemen blockheads, that seldom hear
anything but yourselves? Next after the paper-maker,
who furnished the <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>, takes rank, not the engraver
or illustrator (our modern novelist cannot swim
without this caricaturing villain as one of his bladders;
all higher forms of literature laugh at him), but the
binder; for he, by raising books into ornamental furniture,
has given even to non-intellectual people by myriads a
motive for encouraging literature and an interest in its
extension.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Any specimen of Mr. Ferrar's binding I never saw, but
by those who <i>have</i>, it is said to have been magnificent.
He and his family were once, if not twice, visited by
Charles I., and they presented to that prince a most
sumptuous Bible of their own binding; which Bible, a
lady once told me, was in that collection gradually
formed by George III. at Buckingham House, and
finally presented to the nation by his son. I should
fear it must be in ruins as a specimen of the Little
Gidding workmanship. The man who goes to bed in
his coffin dressed in a jewelled robe and a diamond-hilted
sword, is very liable to a visit from the resurrection-man,
who usually disarms and undresses him. The
Bible that has its binding inlaid with gold, sowed with
Oriental pearl, and made horrent with rubies, suggests
to many a most unscriptural mode of searching into its
treasures, and too like the Miltonic Mammon's mode of
perusing the gorgeous floors of heaven. Besides that, if
the Bible escaped the Parliamentary War, the true <i>art</i> of
the Ferrar family would be better displayed in a case of
less cost and luxury. Certainly, in no one art was the
stupidity of Europe more atrociously recorded than in
this particular art practised by the Ferrars. Boundless
was the field for improvement. And in particular, I
had myself drawn from this art, as practised of old,
one striking memorial of that remarkable genius for
stupidity, which in all ages alike seems to haunt man
as by an inspiration, unless he is roused out of it by
panic. It is this. Look at the lettering&mdash;that is, the
labels lettered with the titles of books&mdash;in all libraries
that are not of recent date. No man would believe that
the very earliest attempt to impress a mark of ownership
upon some bucket of the Argonauts, or the rudest scrawl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of Polyphemus in forging a tarry brand upon some sheep
which he had stolen, could be <i>so</i> bad, <i>so</i> staggering and
illegible, as are these literary inscriptions. How much
better to have had a thin tablet or veneering of marble
or iron adjusted to the back of the book. A stone-cutter
in a rural churchyard once told me that he charged a
penny <i>per</i> letter. That may be cheap for a gravestone,
but it seems rather high for a book. <i>Plato</i> would cost
you fivepence, <i>Aristotle</i> would be shocking; and in
decency you must put him into Latin, which would add
twopence more to every volume. On a library like that
of Dresden or the Vatican, it would raise a national debt
to letter the books.</p>

<br />
<p><i>Cause of the Novel's Decline.</i>&mdash;No man, it may be
safely laid down as a general rule, can obtain a strong
hold over the popular mind without more or less of real
power. A reality there must be. The artifice, the
trickery, cannot arise in this first stage, as by any substitution
of a shadow for a reality. If the mass of readers
<i>feel</i> a power, and acknowledge a power, in that case
power there must be. It was the just remark of Dr.
Johnson that men do not deceive themselves in their
amusements. And amusement it is that the great public
seek in literature. The meaner and the more sensual
the demands of a man are, so much the less possible it
becomes to cheat him. Seeking for warmth, he cannot
be wrong when he says that he has found it. Asking
for <i>alcohol</i>, he will never be cheated with water. His
feelings in such a case, his impressions, instantaneously
justify themselves; that is, they bear witness past all
doubting to the certainty of what they report. So far
there is no opening to mistake. The error, the opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to the spurious on the largest scale, arises first upon the
<i>quality</i> of the power. Strength varies upon an endless
scale, not merely by its own gradations, but by the
modes and the degrees in which it combines with other
qualities. And there are many combinations, cases of
constant recurrence, in which some natural vigour, but
of no remarkable order, enters into alliance with animal
propensities; where a portentous success will indicate
no corresponding power in the artist, but only an unusual
insensibility to decency and the opinion of thoughtful
persons.</p>

<p>Novels are the one sole class of books that ever interest
the public, that reach its heart, or even catch its eye.
And the reason why novels are becoming much more
licentious, and much grosser in the arts by which they
court public favour, lies undoubtedly in the quality of
that new reading public which the extension of education
has added to the old one. An education miserably
shallow, whilst unavailing for any purpose of real elevation,
lets in upon the theatre of what is called by courtesy
literature a vast additional audience that once would
have been excluded altogether. This audience, changed
in no respect from its former condition of intellect and
manners and taste, bringing only the single qualification
of ability to read, is now strong enough in numbers to
impress a new character upon literature in so far as
literature has a motive for applying itself to <i>their</i> wants.
The consequences are showing themselves, and <i>will</i> show
themselves more broadly. It is difficult with proper
delicacy to seek illustrations amongst our own living
writers. Illustrations were all too easily found did we
care to enter on the task.</p>

<p>It is true that, during the currency of any year, whilst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the quantity is liable to indeterminate augmentation,
ballads will be rather looking down in the market. But
that is a shadow which settles upon every earthly good
thing. No Greek book, for instance, amongst the many
that have perished, would so much rejoice many of us
by its resurrection as the comedies of Menander. Yet,
if a correspondent should write word from Pompeii that
twenty-five thousand separate dramas of Menander had
been found in good preservation, adding in a postscript
that forty thousand more had been impounded within
the last two hours, and that there was every prospect of
bagging two hundred thousand more before morning, we
should probably petition Government to receive the importing
vessels with chain-shot. Not even Milton or
Shakespeare could make head against such a Lopez de
Vega principle of ruinous superfluity. Allowing for this
one case of preternatural excess, assuming only that
degree of limitation which any absolute past must almost
always create up to that point, we say that there is no
conceivable composition, or class of compositions, which
will not be welcomed into literature provided, as to
matter, that it shall embody some natural strain of feeling,
and provided, as to manner, that it illustrate the
characteristic style of a known generation.</p>

<p>It might suffice for our present purpose to have once
firmly distinguished between the two modes of literature.
But it may be as well to point out a few corollaries from
this distinction, which will serve at the same time to
explain and to confirm it. For instance, first of all, it
has been abundantly insisted on in our modern times,
that the value of every literature lies in its characteristic
part; a truth certainly, but a truth upon which the
German chanticleer would not have crowed and flapped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
his wings so exultingly, had he perceived the original
and indispensable schism between the literature of knowledge
and the literature of power, because in this latter
only can anything characteristic of a man or of a nation
be embodied. The science of no man can be characteristic,
no man can geometrize or chemically analyze after
a manner peculiar to himself. He may be the first to
open a new road, and in that meaning it may be called
<i>his</i> road; but <i>his</i> it cannot be by any such peculiarities
as will found an <i>incommunicable</i> excellence. In literature
proper, viz., the literature of power, this is otherwise.
There may doubtless have been many imitative poets,
wearing little or nothing of a natural individuality; but
of no poet, that ever <i>led</i> his own class, can it have been
possible that he should have been otherwise than strongly
differenced by inimitable features and by traits not transferable.
Consequently the <ins class="mycorr" title="to">&#964;&#8001;</ins> characteristic, of which in
German cloudland so noisy a proclamation is made as of
some transcendental discovery, is a mere inference from
the very idea of a literature. For we repeat that in
blank knowledge a separate peculiarity marking the individual
is not conceivable, whereas in a true literature
reflecting human nature, not as it represents, but as it
wills, not as a passive minor, but as a self-moving power,
it is not possible to avoid the characteristic except only
in the degree by which the inspiring nature happens to
be feeble. The exorbitations that differentiate them may
be of narrow compass, but only where the motive power
was originally weak. And agreeably to this remark it
may be asserted that in all literature properly so-called
genius, is always manifested, and talent generally; but
in the literature of knowledge it may be doubted very
seriously whether there is any opening for more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
talent. Genius may be defined in the severest manner
as <i>that which is generally characteristic</i>; but a thousand
times we repeat that one man's mode of knowing an
object cannot differ from another man's. It <i>cannot</i> be
characteristic, and its geniality cannot be externally
manifested. To have said, therefore, of the poetry surviving
from ancient Latium, from Castile, from England,
that this is nationally characteristic, and knowable
apart by inalienable differences, is saying no more than
follows out of the very definition by which any and every
literature proper is limited and guarded as a mode of
power.</p>

<p>Secondly, even in the exceptions and hesitations upon
applying the rigour of this distinction, we may read the
natural recognition (however latent or unconscious) of
the rule itself. No man would think, for example, of
placing a treatise on surveying, on mensuration, on geological
stratifications, in any collection of his national
literature. He would be lunatic to do so. A Birmingham
or Glasgow Directory has an equal title to take its station
in the national literature. But he will hesitate on the
same question arising with regard to a history. Where
upon examination the history turns out to be a mere
chronicle, or register of events chronologically arranged,
with no principle of combination pervading it, nor colouring
from peculiar views of policy, nor sympathy with the
noble and impassioned in human action, the decision will
be universal and peremptory to cashier it from the literature.
Yet this case, being one of degree, ranges through
a large and doubtful gamut. A history like that of
Froissart, or of Herodotus, where the subjective from
the writer blends so powerfully with the gross objective,
where the moral picturesque is so predominant, together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
with freshness of sensation which belongs to 'blissful
infancy' in human life, or to a stage of society in
correspondence to it, cannot suffer a demur of jealousy
as to its privilege of entering the select fold of literature.
But such advantages are of limited distribution. And,
to say the truth, in its own nature neither history nor
biography, unless treated with peculiar grace, and architecturally
moulded, has any high pretension to rank as
an organic limb of literature. The very noblest history,
in much of its substance, is but by a special indulgence
within the privilege of that classification. Biography
stands on the same footing. Of the many memorials
dedicated to the life of Milton, how few are entitled to
take their station in the literature! And why? Not
merely that they are disqualified by their defective execution,
but often that they necessarily record what has
become common property.</p>

of the heart against the reality of glory. And partly for these
reasons: 1st, That, <i>hoc abstracto</i>, defrauding man of this, you leave
him miserably bare&mdash;bare of everything. So that really and sincerely
the very wisest men may be seen clinging convulsively, and clutching
with their dying hands the belief that glory, that posthumous fame
(which for profound ends of providence has been endowed with a subtle
power of fraud such as no man can thoroughly look through; for those
who, like myself, despise it most completely, cannot by any art bring
forward a <i>rationale</i>, a theory of its hollowness that will give plenary

the unsearchable hypocrisy of man, that hypocrisy which even to himself

man who should openly have avowed a doctrine that glory was a
bubble, besides that, instead of being prompted to this on a principle
which so far raised him above other men, must have been prompted
by a principle that sank him to the level of the brutes, viz., acquiescing
in total ventrine improvidence, imprescience, and selfish ease (if ease, a
Pagan must have it <i>cum dignitate</i>), but above all he must have made
proclamation that in his opinion all disinterested virtue was a chimera,
since all the quadrifarious virtue of the scholastic ethics was founded
either on personal self-sufficiency, on justice, moderation, etc., etc., or
on direct personal and exclusive self-interest as regarded health and the

Look at our evidences; look at the sort of means by which we often
attempt to gain proselytes among the heathen and at home. Fouler
infidelities there are not. Special pleading, working for a verdict,
etc., etc.</p></div>

<h2><i>XXV. OMITTED PASSAGES AND VARIATIONS.</i></h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<h3>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Rhapsodoi</span>.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following on the 'Rhapsodoi' is a variation on that
which appeared in 'Homer and the Homerid&aelig;,' with
some quite additional and new thoughts on the subject.</p></div>

<br />
<p>About these people, who they were, what relation they
bore to Homer, and why they were called 'Rhapsodoi,'
we have seen debated in Germany through the last half
century with as much rabid ferocity as was ever applied
to the books of a fraudulent bankrupt. Such is the
natural impertinence of man. If he suspects any secret,
or any base attempt to hide and conceal things from
himself, he is miserable until he finds out the mystery,
and especially where all the parties to it have been
defunct for 2,500 years. Great indignation seems reasonably
to have been felt by all German scholars that any
man should presume to have called himself a <i>rhapsodos</i>
at any period of Grecian history without sending down a
sealed letter to posterity stating all the reasons which
induced him to take so unaccountable a step. No possible
solution, given to any conceivable question bearing
upon the 'Rhapsodoi,' seems by any tendency to affect
any question outstanding about Homer. And we do not
therefore understand the propriety of intermingling this
dispute with the general Homeric litigation. However,
to comply with the practice of Germany, we shall throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
away a few sentences upon this, as a pure <i>ad libitum</i>
digression.</p>

<p>The courteous reader, whom we beg also to suppose
the most ignorant of readers, by way of thus founding a
necessity and a case of philosophic reasonableness for
the circumstantiality of our own explanations, will be
pleased to understand that by ancient traditionary usage
the word <i>rhapsodia</i> is the designation technically applied
to the several books or cantos of the 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey.'
So the word <i>fytte</i> has gained a technical appropriation
to our narrative poetry when it takes the ballad form.
Now, the Greek word <i>rhapsody</i> is derived from a tense of
the verb <i>rhapto</i>, to sew as with a needle, to connect, and
<i>ode</i>, a song, chant, or course of singing. If, therefore,
you conceive of a <i>rhapsodia</i>, not as the <i>opera</i>, but as the
<i>opus</i> of a singer, not as the form, but as the result of his
official ministration, viz., as that section of a narrative
poem which forms an intelligible whole in itself, whilst
in a subordinate relation it is one part of a larger whole&mdash;this
idea represents accurately enough the use of the
word <i>rhapsodia</i> in the latter periods of Greek literature.
Suppose the word <i>canto</i> to be taken in its literal etymological
sense, it would indicate a metrical composition
meant to be sung or chanted. But what constitutes the
complexity of the idea in the word <i>rhapsodia</i> is that both
its separate elements, the poetry and the musical delivery,
are equally essential; neither is a casual, neither
a subordinate, element.</p>

<p>Now, the 'Rhapsodoi,' as may be supposed, are the
personal correlates of the <i>rhapsodia.</i> This being the
poem adapted to chanting, those were the chanters.
And the only important question which we can imagine
to arise is, How far in any given age we may presume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the functions of the poetical composer and the musical
deliverer to have been united. We cannot perceive that
any possible relation between a rhapsody considered as a
section of a poem and the whole of that poem, or any
possible relation which this same rhapsody considered as
a thing to be sung or accompanied instrumentally could
bear to the naked-speaking rehearsal of the same poem
or to the original text of that poem, ever can affect the
main question of Homer's integrity. The 'Rhapsodoi'
come to be mentioned at all simply as being one link
in the transmission of the Homeric poems. They are
found existing before Pisistratus, they are found existing
after Pisistratus. And they declined exactly as the art
of reading became general. We can approximate pretty
closely to the time when the 'Rhapsodoi' ceased; but at
what time they began we defy any man to say. Plato
(Rep. x.) represents them as going back into the days of
Homer; nay, according to Plato, Homer himself was
a <i>rhapsodos</i>, and itinerated in that character. So was
Hesiod. And two remarkable lines, ascribed to Hesiod
by one of the Scholiasts upon Pindar, if we could be sure
that they were genuine, settle that question:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 8em;">
<ins class="mycorr" title="En Delo tote pr&ocirc;ton ego xai Homeros aoidoi">&#917;&#957; &#916;&#949;&#955;&#959; &#964;&#959;&#964;&#949; &#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#947;&#959; &#958;&#945;&#953; &#8009;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#953;</ins><br />
<ins class="mycorr" title="Melpomen, en nearois &uacute;mnois rapsantes aoid&ecirc;.">&#924;&#949;&#955;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;, &#949;&#957; &#957;&#949;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#8017;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#961;&#945;&#968;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#945;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#951;</ins><br /><br />
</div>

<p>'Then, first of all,' says Hesiod, 'did I and Homer
chant as bards in Delos, laying the nexus of our poetic
composition in pro&aelig;mial hymns.' We understand him
to mean this: There were many singers and harpers who
sang or accompanied the words of others; perhaps
ancient words&mdash;at all events, not their own. Naturally
he was anxious to have it understood that he and Homer
had higher pretensions. They killed their own mutton.
They composed the words as well as sang them. Where
both functions were so often united in one man's person,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
it became difficult to distinguish them. Our own word
<i>bard</i> or <i>minstrel</i> stood in the same ambiguity. You
could not tell in many cases whether the word pointed
to the man's poetic or musical faculty. Anticipating
that doubt, Hesiod says that they sang as original poets.
For it is a remark of Suidas, which he deduces laboriously,
that poetry, being uniformly sung in the elder
Greece, acquired the name of <ins class="mycorr" title="aoid&ecirc;">&#945;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#951;</ins>. This term became
technically appropriated to the poetry, or substance
of whatever was sung, in contradistinction to the musical
accompaniment. And the poet was called <ins class="mycorr" title="aoidos">&#945;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#962;</ins> So
far Hesiod twice over secures the dignity of their office
from misinterpretation. And there, by the word <ins class="mycorr" title="raphantes">&#961;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</ins>
he indicates the sort of poetry which they cultivated,
viz., that which was expanded into long heroic narratives,
and naturally connected itself both internally amongst
its own parts, and externally with other poems of the
same class. Thus, having separated Homer and himself
from the mere musicians, next he separates them even as
poets from those who simply composed hymns to the
Gods. These heroic legends were known to require
much more elaborate study and art. Yet, because a
critical reviewer might take occasion to tax his piety
in thus composing human legends in neglect of the Gods,
Hesiod, forestalling him, replies: 'You're out there, my
friend; we were both pious, and we put our piety into
hymns addressed to the Gods, which, with cabinetmakers'
skill, we used also as interludes of transition
from one legend to another.' For it is noticed frequently
and especially by a Scholiast on Aristophanes (Pac. 826),
that generally speaking the <i>pro&aelig;mia</i> to the different
parts of narrative-poems were entirely detached, <ins class="mycorr" title="kai ouden
pros to pragma d&ecirc;lon">&#954;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#948;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#957;</ins>, and explain nothing at all that concerns
the business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>


<h3>2.&mdash;Mrs. Evans and the 'Gazette.'</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>In his autobiographic sketch, 'Introduction to the World
of Strife,' he tells of his brother's enterprise in establishing
the <i>Gazette</i>, which was to record their doings, and
also of Mrs. Evans's place on the <i>Gazette.</i> The following
is evidently a passage which was prepared for that
part of the article, but was from some cause or other
omitted:</p></div>

<br />
<p>I suppose no creature ever led such a life as I led
on the <i>Gazette</i>; sometimes running up, like Wallenstein,
to the giddiest pinnacles of honour, then down again
without notice or warning to the dust; cashiered&mdash;rendered
incapable of ever serving H. M. again; nay,
actually drummed out of the army, my uniform stripped
off, and the 'rogue's march' played after me. And
all for what? I protest, to this hour, I have no guess.
If any person knows, that person is not myself; and the
reader is quite as well able to furnish guesses to me as I
to him&mdash;to enlighten <i>me</i> upon the subject as I <i>him.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Evans was a very important person in the play;
I don't suppose that things could have gone on without
<i>her.</i> For, as there was no writer in the <i>Gazette</i> but my
brother, so there was no reader of it except Mrs. Evans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
And here came in a shocking annoyance to me that, as
often as any necessity occurred (which was every third
day) for restoring me to my rank, since my brother
would not have it supposed that he could be weak enough
to initiate such an indulgence, the <i>Gazette</i> threw the
<i>onus</i> of this amiable weakness, and consequently of my
gratitude, upon Mrs. Evans, affirming that the major-general
had received a pardon and an amnesty for all his
past atrocities at the request of 'a distinguished lady,'
who was obscurely indicated in a parenthesis as 'the
truly honourable Mrs. Evans.' To listen to the <i>Gazette</i>
one would have supposed that this woman, who so
cordially detested me, spent her whole time in going
down on her knees and making earnest supplications to
the throne on my behalf. But what signified the representations
of the <i>Gazette</i> if I knew them to be false?
Aye, but I did not know that they were false. It is
true that my obligations to her were quite aerial, and
might, as the reader will think, have been supported
without any preternatural effort. But exactly these
aerial burdens, whether of gratitude or of honour, most
oppressed me as being least tangible and incapable
of pecuniary or other satisfaction. No sinking fund
could meet them. And even the dull unimaginative
woman herself, eternally held up to admiration as my
resolute benefactress, got the habit (I am sure) of looking
upon me as under nameless obligations to her. This
raised my wrath. It was not that to my feelings the
obligations were really a mere figment of pretence. On
the contrary, according to my pains endured, they
towered up to the clouds. But I felt that nobody had
any right to load me with favours that I had never asked
for, and without leave even asked from me; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
more real were the favours, the deeper the wrong done
to me. I sought, therefore, for some means of retaliation.
And it is odd that it was not till thirty years after
that I perceived one. It then struck me that the eternal
intercession might have been equally odious to her. To
find herself prostrate for ever, weeping like Niobe, and,
if the <i>Gazette</i> was to be believed, refusing to raise herself
from the mud or the flinty pavement till I had been
forgiven, and reinstated in my rank&mdash;ah, how loathsome
that must have been to her! Ah, how loathsome
the whole cycle of favours were to me, considering from
whom they came! Then we had effectually plagued
each other. And it was not without loud laughter, as of
malice unexpectedly triumphant, that I found one night
thirty years after, on regretting my powerlessness of
vengeance, that, in fact, I had amply triumphed thirty
years before. So, undaunted Mrs. Evans, if you live
anywhere within call, listen to the assurance that all
accounts are squared between us, and that we balanced
our mutual debts by mutual disgust; and that, if you
plagued me perversely, I plagued you unconsciously.</p>

<p>And though shot and bullets were forbidden fruit, yet
something might be done with hard wadding. A good
deal of classical literature disappeared in this way,
which by one who valued no classics very highly might
be called the way of all flesh. The best of authors, he
contended, had better perish by this warlike consummation
than by the inglorious enmity of bookworms and
moths&mdash;honeycombed, as most of the books had been
which had gone out to India with our two uncles. Even
wadding, however, was declared to be inadmissible as
too dangerous, after wounds had been inflicted more
than once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>


<h3>3.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Lawsuit Legacy</span>.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>De Quincey, in his autobiographic sketch headed
'Laxton,' tells of the fortune of Miss Watson, who afterwards
became Lady Carbery, and also of the legacy left to
her in the form of a lawsuit by her father against the
East India Company; and among his papers we find the
following passage either overlooked or omitted, for some
undiscoverable reason, from that paper, though it has a
value in its own way as expressing some of De Quincey's
views on law and equity; and it is sufficiently characteristic
to be included here:</p></div>

<br />
<p>In consequence of her long minority, Miss Watson
must have succeeded at once to six thousand a year on
completing her twenty-first year; and she also inherited
a Chancery-suit, which sort of property is <i>now</i> (1853)
rather at a discount in public estimation; but let the
reader assure himself that even the Court of Chancery is
not quite so black as it is painted; that the true ground
for the delays and ruinous expenses in ninety-nine out of
one hundred instances is not legal chicanery, still less the
wilful circuitousness and wordiness of law processes, but
the great eternal fact that, what through lapse of time,
decays of memory, and loss of documents, and what
through interested suppressions of truth, and the disper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>sions
of witnesses, and causes by the score beside, the
ultimate truth and equity of human disputes is a matter
of prodigious perplexity; neither is there any possibility
that the mass of litigations as to property ever <i>can</i> be
made cheap except in proportion as it is made dismally
imperfect.</p>

<p>No power that ever yet was lodged in senates or in
councils <i>could</i> avail, ever <i>has</i> availed, ever <i>will</i> avail, to
intercept the immeasurable expansion of that law which
grows out of social expansion. Fast as the relations of
man multiply, and the modifications of property extend,
must the corresponding adaptations of the law run alongside.
The pretended arrests applied to this heaving volcanic
system of forces by codifications, like those of Justinian
or Napoleon, had not lasted for a year before all had
broke loose from its moorings, and was again going ahead
with redoubling impetus. Equally delusive are the prospects
held out that the new system of cheap provincial
justice will be a change unconditionally for the better.
Already the complaints against it are such in bitterness
and extent as to show that in very many cases it must be
regarded as a failure; and, where it is not, that it must be
regarded as a compromise: once you had 8 degrees of the
advantage X, 4 of Y; now you have 7 of X, 5 of Y.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>


<h3>4.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The True Justifications of War.</span></h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>The following was evidently intended to appear in the
article on <i>War</i>:</p></div>
<br />

<p>'Most of what has been written on this subject (the
cruelty of war), in connection with the apparently fierce
ethics of the Old Testament, is (with submission to
sentimentalists) false and profoundly unphilosophic. It
is of the same feeble character as the flashy modern
moralizations upon War. The true justifications of war
lie far below the depths of any soundings taken upon the
charts of effeminate earth-born ethics. And ethics of
God, the Scriptural ethics, search into depths that
are older and less measurable, contemplate interests that
are more mysterious and entangled with perils more
awful than merely human philosophy has resources for
appreciating. It is not at all impossible that a crisis has
sometimes arisen for the human race, in which its capital
interest may be said to have ridden at single anchor.
Upon the issue of a single struggle between the powers of
light and darkness&mdash;upon a motion, a bias, an impulse
given this way or that&mdash;all may have been staked. Out
of Judaism came Christianity, and the mere possibility of
Christianity. From elder stages of the Hebrew race,
hidden in thick darkness to us, descended the only pure
glimpse allowed to man of God's nature. Traditionally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
but through many generations, and fighting at every stage
with storms or with perils more than ever were revealed
to <i>us</i>, this idea of God, this holy seed of truth, like some
secret jewel passing onwards through armies of robbers,
made its way downward to an age in which it became
the matrix of Christianity. The solitary acorn had
reached in safety the particular soil in which it was first
capable of expanding into a forest. The narrow, but at
the same time austere, truth of Judaism, furnished the
basis which by magic, as it were, burst suddenly and
expanded into a vast superstructure, no longer fitted for
the apprehension of one single unamiable race, but offering
shelter and repose to the whole family of man. These
things are most remarkable about this memorable trans-migration
of one faith into another, of an imperfect into
a perfect religion, viz., that the early stage had but a
slight resemblance to the latter, nor could have prefigured
it to a human sagacity more than a larva could prefigure
a chrysalis; and, secondly, that whereas the product,
viz., Christianity, never has been nor will be in any danger
of ruin, the germ, viz., the Judaic idea of God, the great
radiation through which the Deity kept open His communication
with man, apparently must more than once
have approached an awful struggle for life. This solitary
taper of truth, struggling across a howling wilderness of
darkness, had it been ever totally extinguished, could
probably never have been reillumined. It may seem an
easy thing for a mere human philosophy to recover, and
steadily to maintain a pure Hebrew conception of God;
but so far is this from being true, that we believe it possible
to expose in the closest Pagan approximation to this
Hebrew type some adulterous elements such as would
have ensured its relapse into idolatrous impurity.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>


<h3>5.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Philosophy Defeated.</span></h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>We have come upon a passage which is omitted from
the 'Confessions,' and as it is, in every way, characteristic,
we shall give it:</p></div>
<br />

<p>My studies have now been long interrupted. I cannot
read to myself with any pleasure, hardly with a moment's
endurance. Yet I read aloud sometimes for the pleasure
of others&mdash;because reading is an accomplishment of mine,
and, in the slang use of the word 'accomplishment' as
a superficial and ornamental attainment, almost the only
one I possess&mdash;and, formerly, if I had any vanity at all
connected with any endowment or attainment of mine,
it was with this; for I had observed that no accomplishment
was so rare. Players are the worst readers of all; &mdash;&mdash; reads
vilely, and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, who is so celebrated,
can read nothing well but dramatic compositions&mdash;Milton
she cannot read sufferably. People in general
read poetry without any passion at all, or else overstep
the modesty of nature and read not like scholars. Of
late, if I have felt moved by anything in books, it has
been by the grand lamentations of 'Samson Agonistes,'
or the great harmonies of the Satanic speaker in 'Paradise
Regained,' when read aloud by myself. A young
lady sometimes comes and drinks tea with us. At her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
request and M&mdash;&mdash;'s I now and then read W&mdash;&mdash;'s
poems to them. (W&mdash;&mdash;, by-the-bye, is the only poet
I ever met who could read his own verses. Blank verse
he reads admirably.)</p>

<p>This, then, has been the extent of my reading for upwards
of sixteen months. It frets me to enter those
rooms of my cottage in which the books stand. In one of
them, to which my little boy has access, he has found out
a use for some of them. Somebody has given him a bow
and arrows&mdash;God knows who, certainly not I, for I have
not energy or ingenuity to invent a walking-stick&mdash;thus
equipped for action, he rears up the largest of the folios
that he can lift, places them on a tottering base, and
then shoots until he brings down the enemy. He often
presses me to join him; and sometimes I consent, and we
are both engaged together in these intellectual labours.
We build up a pile, having for its base some slender
modern metaphysician, ill able (poor man!) to sustain such
a weight of philosophy. Upon this we place the Dutch
quartos of Descartes and Spinoza; then a third story of
Schoolmen in folio&mdash;the Master of Sentences, Suarez,
Picus Mirandula, and the Telemonian bulk of Thomas
Aquinas; and when the whole architecture seems firm
and compact, we finish our system of metaphysics by
roofing the whole with Duval's enormous Aristotle. So
far there is some pleasure&mdash;building up is something, but
what is that to destroying? Thus thinks, at least, my
little companion, who now, with the wrath of the Pythian
Apollo, assumes his bow and arrows; plants himself in
the remotest corner of the room, and prepares his fatal
shafts. The bow-string twangs, flights of arrows are in
the air, but the Dutch impregnability of the Bergen-op-Zooms
at the base receives the few which reach the mark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
and they recoil without mischief done. Again the baffled
archer collects his arrows, and again he takes his station.
An arrow issues forth, and takes effect on a weak side of
Thomas. Symptoms of dissolution appear&mdash;the cohesion
of the system is loosened&mdash;the Schoolmen begin to totter;
the Stagyrite trembles; Philosophy rocks to its centre;
and, before it can be seen whether time will do anything
to heal their wounds, another arrow is planted in the
schism of their ontology; the mighty structure heaves&mdash;reels&mdash;seems
in suspense for one moment, and then, with
one choral crash&mdash;to the frantic joy of the young Sagittary&mdash;lies
subverted on the floor! Kant and Aristotle,
Nominalists and Realists, Doctors Seraphic or Irrefragable,
what cares he? All are at his feet&mdash;the Irrefragable
has been confuted by his arrows, the Seraphic has been
found mortal, and the greatest philosopher and the least
differ but according to the brief noise they have made.</p>

<p>For nearly two years I believe that I read no book but
one, and I owe it to the author, Mr. Ricardo, to make
grateful record of it.</p>

<p>And then he proceeds:</p>

<p>Suddenly, in 1818, a friend in Edinburgh sent me
down Mr. Ricardo's book, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>


<h3>6.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Highwayman's Skeleton</span>.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>In the account which De Quincey gives of the highwayman's
skeleton, which figured in the museum of the distinguished
surgeon, Mr. White, in his chapter in the
'Autobiographic Sketches' headed 'The Manchester
Grammar School,' he was evidently restrained from
inserting one passage, which we have found among his
papers, from considerations of delicacy towards persons
who might then still be living. But as he has there
plainly given the names of the leading persons concerned&mdash;the
famous Surgeon Cruikshank,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> there can at this
time of day be little risk of offending or hurting anyone
by presenting the passage, which the curious student of
the Autobiography can insert at the proper point, and
may feel that its presence adds to the completeness of
the impression, half-humorous, half-<i>eerie</i>, which De
Quincey was fain to produce by that somewhat grim
episode. Here is the passage:</p></div>

<br />
<p>It was a regular and respectable branch of public industry
which was carried on by the highwaymen of
England, and all the parties to it moved upon decent
motives and by considerate methods. In particular, the
robbers themselves, as the leading parties, could not be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>other than first-rate men, as regarded courage, animal
vigour, and perfect horsemanship. Starting from any
lower standard than this, not only had they no chance
of continued success&mdash;their failure was certain as regarded
the contest with the traveller, but also their
failure was equally certain as regarded the competition
within their own body. The candidates for a lucrative
section of the road were sure to become troublesome in
proportion as all administration of the business upon
that part of the line was feebly or indiscreetly worked.
Hence it arose that individually the chief highwaymen
were sure to command a deep professional interest
amongst the surgeons of the land. Sometimes it
happened that a first-rate robber was arrested and
brought to trial, but from defective evidence escaped.
Meanwhile his fine person had been locally advertised
and brought under the notice of the medical body.
This had occurred in a more eminent degree than was
usual to the robber who had owned when living the
matchless skeleton possessed by Mr. White. He had
been most extensively surveyed with anatomical eyes
by the whole body of the medical profession in London:
their deliberate judgment upon him was that a more
absolutely magnificent figure of a man did not exist in
England than this highwayman, and naturally therefore
very high sums were offered to him as soon as his condemnation
was certain. The robber, whose name I
entirely forget, finally closed with the offer of Cruikshank,
who was at that time the most eminent surgeon in
London. Those days, as is well known, were days of
great irregularity in all that concerned the management
of prisons and the administration of criminal justice.
Consequently there is no reason for surprise or for doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
in the statement made by Mr. White, that Cruikshank,
whose pupil Mr. White then was, received some special
indulgences from one of the under-sheriffs beyond what
the law would strictly have warranted. The robber was
cut down considerably within the appointed time, was
instantly placed in a chaise-and-four, and was thus
brought so prematurely into the private rooms of
Cruikshank, that life was not as yet entirely extinct.
This I heard Mr. White repeatedly assert. He was
himself at that time amongst the pupils of Cruikshank,
and three or four of the most favoured amongst these
were present, and to one of them Cruikshank observed
quietly: 'I think the subject is not quite dead; pray put
your knife in (Mr. X. Y.) at this point.' That was done;
a solemn <i>finis</i> was placed to the labours of the robber,
and perhaps a solemn inauguration to the labours of
the student. A cast was taken from the superb figure
of the highwayman; he was then dissected, his skeleton
became the property of Cruikshank, and subsequently of
Mr. White. We were all called upon to admire the fine
proportions of the man, and of course in that hollow
and unmeaning way which such unlearned expressors
of judgment usually assume, we all obsequiously met the
demand levied upon our admiration. But, for my part,
though readily confiding in the professional judgment
of anatomists, I could not but feel that through my own
unassisted judgment I never could have arrived at such
a conclusion. The unlearned eye has gathered no
rudimental points to begin with. Not having what are
the normal outlines to which the finest proportions
tend, an eye so untutored cannot of course judge in what
degree the given subject approaches to these.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>


<h3>7.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Ransom for Waterloo</span>.</h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>The following gives a variation on a famous passage in
the 'Dream Fugue,' and it may be interesting to the
reader to compare it with that which the author printed.
From these variations it will be seen that De Quincey
often wrote and re-wrote his finest passages, and sometimes,
no doubt, found it hard to choose between the
readings:</p></div><br />


<p>Thus as we ran like torrents; thus as with bridal
rapture our flying equipage swept over the <i>campo santo</i>
of the graves; thus as our burning wheels carried
warrior instincts, kindled earthly passions amongst the
trembling dust below us, suddenly we became aware of
a vast necropolis to which from afar we were hurrying.
In a moment our maddening wheels were nearing it.</p>

<p>'Of purple granite in massive piles was this city of the
dead, and yet for one moment it lay like a visionary
purple stain on the horizon, so mighty was the distance.
In the second moment this purple city trembled through
many changes, and grew as by fiery pulsations, so
mighty was the pace. In the third moment already
with our dreadful gallop we were entering its suburbs.
Systems of sarcophagi rose with crests aerial of terraces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and turrets into the upper glooms, strode forward with
haughty encroachment upon the central aisle, ran back
with mighty shadows into answering recesses. When
the sarcophagi wheeled, then did our horses wheel.
Like rivers in horned floods wheeling in pomp of unfathomable
waters round headlands; like hurricanes
that ride into the secrets of forests, faster than ever light
travels through the wilderness of darkness, we shot the
angles, we fled round the curves of the labyrinthine
city. With the storm of our horses' feet, and of our
burning wheels, did we carry earthly passions, kindle
warrior instincts amongst the silent dust around us,
dust of our noble fathers that had slept in God since
Creci. Every sarcophagus showed many bas-reliefs,
bas-reliefs of battles, bas-reliefs of battlefields, battles
from forgotten ages, battles from yesterday; battlefields
that long since Nature had healed and reconciled to
herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers; battlefields
that were yet angry and crimson with carnage.</p>

<p>And now had we reached the last sarcophagus,
already we were abreast of the last bas-relief; already
we were recovering the arrow-like flight of the central
aisle, when coming up it in counterview to ourselves we
beheld the frailest of cars, built as might seem from
floral wreaths, and from the shells of Indian seas. Half
concealed were the fawns that drew it by the floating
mists that went before it in pomp. But the mists hid
not the lovely countenance of the infant girl that sate
wistful upon the ear, and hid not the birds of tropic
plumage with which she played. Face to face she rode
forward to meet us, and baby laughter in her eyes
saluted the ruin that approached. 'Oh, baby,' I said
in anguish, 'must we that carry tidings of great joy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
every people be God's messengers of ruin to thee?' In
horror I rose at the thought. But then also, in horror
at the thought, rose one that was sculptured in the bas-relief&mdash;a
dying trumpeter. Solemnly from the field of
Waterloo he rose to his feet, and, unslinging his stony
trumpet, carried it in his dying anguish to his stony lips,
sounding once, and yet once again, proclamation that
to <i>thy</i> ears, oh baby, must have spoken from the battlements
of death. Immediately deep shadows fell between
us, and shuddering silence. The choir had ceased to
sing; the uproar of our laurelled equipage alarmed the
graves no more. By horror the bas-relief had been
unlocked into life. By horror we that were so full of
life&mdash;we men, and our horses with their fiery forelegs
rising in mid-air to their everlasting gallop&mdash;were petrified
to a bas-relief. Oh, glacial pageantry of death, that
from end to end of the gorgeous cathedral for a moment
froze every eye by contagion of panic. Then for the
third time the trumpet sounded. Back with the shattering
burst came the infinite rushing of life. The seals of
frost were raised from our stifling hearts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>


<h3>8.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Desiderium.</span></h3>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Here is another variation on a famous passage in the
'Autobiographic Sketches,' which will give the reader
some further opportunity for comparison:</p></div>

<br />
<p>At six years of age, or thereabouts (I write without
any memorial notes), the glory of this earth for me was
extinguished. <i>It is finished</i>&mdash;not those words but that
sentiment&mdash;was the misgiving of my prophetic heart;
thought it was that gnawed like a worm, that did not
and that could not die. 'How, child,' a cynic would
have said, if he had deciphered the secret reading of my
sighs&mdash;'at six years of age, will you pretend that life
has already exhausted its promises? Have you communicated
with the grandeurs of earth? Have you
read Milton? Have you seen Rome? Have you heard
Mozart?' No, I had <i>not</i>, nor could in those years have
appreciated any one of them if I had; and, therefore,
undoubtedly the crown jewels of our little planet were
still waiting for me in the rear. Milton and Rome and
'Don Giovanni' were yet to come. But it mattered not
what remained when set over against what had been
taken away. <i>That</i> it was which I sought for ever in
my blindness. The love which had existed between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
myself and my departed sister, <i>that</i>, as even a child
could feel, was not a light that could be rekindled. No
voice on earth could say, 'Come again!' to a flower of
Paradise like that. Love, such as that is given but once
to any. Exquisite are the perceptions of childhood, not
less so than those of maturest wisdom, in what touches
the capital interests of the heart. And no arguments,
nor any consolations, could have soothed me into a
moment's belief, that a wound so ghastly as mine
admitted of healing or palliation. Consequently, as I
stood more alone in the very midst of a domestic circle
than ever Christian traveller in an African Bilidulgerid
amidst the tents of infidels, or the howls of lions, day
and night&mdash;in the darkness and at noon-day&mdash;I sate, I
stood, I lay, moping like an idiot, craving for what was
impossible, and seeking, groping, snatching, at that which
was irretrievable for ever.</p>
